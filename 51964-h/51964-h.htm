    <h2>
      THE WRITER'S APOLOGY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE greater number
      of the papers in this series, dealing with some well-known persons and
      incidents of the latter half of the Eighteenth Century, are the practical
      result of a long conversation which the writer had with the late Professor
      J. Churton Collins upon a very memorable occasion. The writer ventured to
      contend that the existing views respecting the personality of Oliver
      Goldsmith, of Henry Thrale, of James Boswell, of Samuel Johnson, and of
      some others whom he named, were grossly erroneous; as were also the
      prevalent notions respecting such matters as Fanny Burney's attendance
      upon the Queen, the &ldquo;romance&rdquo; of the Gunnings, and the &ldquo;elopement&rdquo; of
      Richard Brinsley Sheridan with Elizabeth Linley. If Professor Churton
      Collins had not urged upon the writer the possible interest attaching to
      the expression of some opinions unbiassed by those conservators of the
      conventional who have dealt with the same period, every one of them being
      as careful as Indians on the warpath to tread in the footsteps of the man
      preceding him, he would not have the courage to set forth his views in the
      form they now assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The non-controversial papers in the series may increase the light and
      shade in the sketches of this very humble Georgian Pageant. The romance of
      Lady Susan Fox-Strangways naturally took the shape of a &ldquo;regulation&rdquo;
       story. The details are absolutely correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very day the writer meant to keep the promise he made to Professor
      Churton Collins, by sending him the completed proofs of this book, the
      melancholy news of his death was published&mdash;an irreparable loss to
      the Literature of English Criticism.

    <h2>
      THE MONARCH OF THE PAGEANT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the morning of
      February 2nd, 1789, a lady was taking a solitary stroll in Kew Gardens.
      She was a small person, of dainty features, with a dimple on each side of
      her mouth that suggested a smile, varying, perhaps out of compliment to
      the variations of the people with whom she came in contact in her daily
      life, and shifting doubtless with the movements of the folk of her fancy
      through her quick brain, but remaining a smile all the time. There was
      about her a good deal of that doll-like primness which is so pretty an
      accompaniment of a person of small stature; but with this particular
      person it had&mdash;not quite, but almost&mdash;the additional charm of
      dignity. One could at all times see that she was making a highly
      intellectual attempt to be dignified; but that she was not really
      dignified at heart. One could see that she had too fine a sense of humour
      to be thoroughly dignified; and it may be that some of her closest
      observers&mdash;her closest observers were her greatest admirers&mdash;perceived
      now and again that she had a full sense of the humour of her efforts in
      the direction of dignity. She had large eyes, but being very
      short-sighted, she had a habit of half closing them when looking at
      anything or any one further away from her than ten feet. But somehow it
      was never suggested that the falling of her lids brought a frown to her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a quick walker at all times; but on this winter day the slowest
      would have had little temptation to dawdle. The usual river mist was
      thrusting up a quivering cold hand among the gaunt trees of the water
      boundary of the Gardens, and here and there it flitted like a lean spectre
      among the clipped evergreens of the shrubberies. There was a maze of yew
      hedges, in the intricacies of which one mist-spectre had clearly got lost;
      and the lady, who had some imagination, could see, as she hurried past,
      the poor thing's wispy head and shoulders flitting about among the
      baffling central walks. (A defective eyesight is sometimes a good friend
      to the imagination.) And all the while she was hurrying along the broad
      track she was looking with some measure of uneasiness through her
      half-closed eyes down every tributary walk that ran into the main one, and
      peering uneasily down every long artificial vista that Sir Thomas
      Chambers, the Swedish knight and landscape gardener, had planned, through
      the well-regulated boskage, with an imitation Greek temple or Roman villa
      at the end. Approaching the widening entrance to each of these, she went
      cautiously for a few moments until she had assured herself on some point.
      Once she started and took a step backward, but raising the lorgnette which
      she carried, and satisfying herself that the group of men a hundred yards
      down one of the vistas was composed wholly of gardeners, she resumed her
      stroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever slight apprehension may have been on her mind had vanished by the
      time she had half completed the circuit made by the main walk. She had
      reached one of the mounds which at that time were covered with
      rhododendrons, and paused for a moment to see if there was sign of a bud.
      A blackbird flew out from among the dense leafage, and she followed it
      with her eyes as well as she could while she walked on, crossing the
      narrow path that led to the seats on the mound. But at the moment of
      crossing she was startled out of her senses by the sound of a shout from
      some distance down this path&mdash;a loud shout followed by several others
      rather less imperative. She gave a little exclamation of terror, raising
      her muff to her face. Glancing in the direction whence the commotion was
      coming, she gave another cry, seeing a tall man rush toward her with
      outstretched arms&mdash;waving arms, frantically beckoning to her while he
      shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney! Miss Burney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited no longer. She turned and fled along the broad walk, making for
      one of the many labyrinths not so very far away, and after her ran the
      man, still shouting and gesticulating. She could hear the sound of his
      feet and his voice behind her, as well as the cries of the other men who
      were endeavouring to keep pace with him. On they came, and there flashed
      through her active brain, in spite of the horrible apprehension which
      thrilled through every nerve in her body, as she doubled back upon the
      path which she had just traversed, the lines written by Dr. Goldsmith and
      often quoted by her friend Dr. Johnson:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A hare whom hounds and horns pursue,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Pants to the place from whence at first he flew.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She realised, all too painfully, the feelings of the poor hare at that
      moment. She longed for a friendly earth to open up before her. They were
      behind her&mdash;those wild huntsmen, one hoarsely yelling to her she knew
      not what, the others, more shrill, shouting to her to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too frightened to think of obeying any of them. On she ran, and it
      seemed that she was increasing the distance between her and her panting
      pursuers, until one of them, having better wind, managed to shoot ahead of
      the others, and to get close enough to say in a voice that was not all
      gasps:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, madam, the doctor begs you to stop!&rdquo; She glanced over her
      shoulder, still flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I cannot&mdash;I dare not!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you must&mdash;you must: it hurts the King to run!&rdquo; cried the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she stopped. The man, an ordinary attendant, stood in front of her.
      He was more breathless than Miss Burney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor, madam,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;'twas the doctor&mdash;he thought at
      first that His Majesty was&mdash;was&mdash;but that was at first&mdash;now
      he says you must please not lead His Majesty on&mdash;'tis all too much
      for him. Save us! How you did go, madam! Who would ha' thought it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was paying no attention to him. Her eyes were fixed upon the group of
      men who were recovering their breath while they walked slowly toward her.
      The King was between his two physicians&mdash;not Physicians in Ordinary;
      just the contrary&mdash;the two physicians who had been summoned from
      Lincolnshire by some person in authority who possessed intelligence&mdash;it
      should surely be easy to identify such a man at the Court of George III&mdash;when,
      some months earlier, His Majesty gave signs of losing his mental balance.
      They were the Willises, father and son, the former a clergyman, who was
      therefore all the more fully qualified to deal with a mind diseased&mdash;such
      a case as was defined as needing more the divine than the physician. The
      King was between the father and his son, but neither of them was
      exercising any ostentatious or officious restraint upon him. One of them
      was smiling while he said some reassuring words to the Royal patient; the
      other was endeavouring to reassure little Miss Burney from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed that the intentions of both were realised, for His Majesty
      was smiling as benignly as was ever his wont, and little Miss Burney took
      her courage in both hands and boldly advanced to meet her Sovereign. (She
      had been for three years the Queen's &ldquo;Dresser.&rdquo;) But when they met, after
      the King had cried, &ldquo;Why did you run away from me, Miss Burney?&rdquo; it
      appeared that the process of reassuring the King had been but too
      effectually accomplished, for before the lady could frame a diplomatic
      reply to his inquiry, he had enwound her in his paternal arms and kissed
      her heartily on the cheek, greatly to her confusion and (she pretends) to
      her horror. The two doctors stood placidly by. They, poor things, being
      quite unaccustomed to the ways of the immediate entourage of the Court of
      George III&mdash;though they had doubtless heard something of the
      practices that prevailed at the Courts of His Majesty's lamented
      grandfather and great-grandfather&mdash;seemed under the impression that
      there was nothing unusual in this form of salutation. For all they knew it
      might be regarded as <i>de rigueur</i> between a monarch and the ladies of
      his consort's retinue. Even Dr. Willis, the divine, took a tolerant view
      of the transaction. He, as Miss Burney afterwards recorded, actually
      looked pleased!
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of course, the prim little lady herself was overwhelmed&mdash;yes, at
      first; but soon her good sense came to her rescue. She seems to have come
      with extraordinary rapidity to the conclusion that the King was not so mad
      as she had believed him to be. Her train of reasoning was instinctive, and
      therefore correct: the King had put his arms about her and kissed her when
      he had the chance, therefore he could not be so mad after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, however, Fanny Burney took the view of her treatment that any
      sensible modest young woman would take of it. She knew that the King, who
      had been separated for several months from the people whom he had been
      daily in the habit of meeting, had shown in the most natural way possible
      his delight at coming once more in contact with one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And undoubtedly the homely old gentleman was delighted beyond measure to
      meet with some one belonging to his happy years&mdash;a pleasanter face
      than that of Mrs. Schwellenberg, the dreadful creature who had made Fanny
      Burney's life miserable. It is not conceivable that the King would have
      kissed Mrs. Schwellenberg if he had come upon her suddenly as he had upon
      Miss Burney. People prefer silver rather than iron links with a happy
      past. He was so overjoyed, that the divine and the physician in attendance
      soon became anxious. They could not know much of all that he talked about
      to Miss Burney. They were in the position of strangers suddenly introduced
      to a family circle, and understanding nothing of the little homely secrets&mdash;homely
      topics upon which all the members of the circle have laughed together for
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      They possibly could not see much sense in his long and rambling chat&mdash;it
      must have been largely in monologue&mdash;but they must have observed the
      face of the lady who was listening to him, and known from the expression
      which it wore that their patient was making himself intelligible. Only now
      and again they thought it prudent to check his exuberance. They must have
      been the most intelligent of men; and their names deserve to stand high in
      the annals of their country. At a time when the scientific treatment of
      the insane had not even begun to be formulated&mdash;when to be mentally
      afflicted meant to be on a level with felons and to be subjected to such
      repressive treatment as was afforded by the iron of the fetters and the
      hiss of the whipcord&mdash;at a time when a lust for office could make a
      statesman like Burke (a statesman who caused multitudes to weep in
      sympathy with his harangue on the sufferings of Marie Antoinette) refer to
      the King as having been &ldquo;hurled by the Almighty from his throne&rdquo; (in order
      to give the Opposition a chance of jumping into place and power over his
      prostrate body)&mdash;at such a time as this Dr. Willis and his two sons
      undertook the treatment of the King, and in the face of much opposition
      from the place-hunters in the Prince of Wales's pack, succeeded in
      restoring their patient to the palace which his happy nature had
      transformed into a home for every one dwelling under its roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood by for some time after the King had greeted Miss Burney; and
      when he began to speak to her of topics that had a purely domestic ring
      they showed their good taste, as well as their knowledge of the
      peculiarities of their &ldquo;case,&rdquo; by moving away to a little distance,
      signalling to their attendants to do the same. Their discrimination must
      have been highly appreciated by the King. The poor restless mind had long
      wanted such a good long talk with a sympathetic listener, who, he knew,
      could understand every allusion that he might make to the past. He yearned
      to talk and to hear of such things as some one living in a distant land
      looks forward to finding in a letter from home. The <i>res angusta domi</i>&mdash;that
      was what he was hungering for&mdash;the trivial things in which he
      delighted&mdash;the confidences on simple matters&mdash;the sly everyday
      jests, never acutely pointed even to the family circle, but absolutely
      pointless to every one outside, yet sounding so delightfully witty when
      repeated as a sign of a happy intimacy of the past!

      Little Miss Burney had never imagined a scene like that in which she
      played an insignificant part at the moment, but one of enormous importance
      for posterity. She had, a few years before, been placed upon the porphyry
      pedestal which is reserved in England for the greatest woman writer of the
      generation. Seated there quite complacently, without reflecting upon the
      possibility of her pedestal becoming a trifle rickety, she had clasped her
      novel <i>Evelina</i> to her bosom, and received, without her head being in
      the least turned, the adulation&mdash;respectful in some cases, almost
      passionate in others&mdash;of the most notable men and women in the most
      intellectual and artistic society in England. Dr. Samuel Johnson, who was
      not disposed to overrate the merits of any writer whom the world had
      praised, was kissing her hands, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan was kissing
      her feet; Sir Joshua Reynolds was kissing the hem of her garments; while
      Edmund Burke was weaving a tinsel crown of rhetoric for her shapely head;
      but there were others equally great at that time who seemed to think that
      only a nimbus could give the appropriate finish to the little personage on
      the pedestal. The marvellous story of her success has been often told. It
      is more easily told than understood in the present day, the fact being
      that fashion in fiction is the most ephemeral of all human caprices, and
      Fanny Burney was essentially a fashion. She followed up the marvellous
      success of <i>Evelina</i>, after an interval of four years, with the
      natural success of <i>Cecilia</i>, and, after another four years, she
      retired from the brilliant world into the obscurity of the palace&mdash;the
      palace wardrobe. She had visited Mrs. Delany, and had been introduced (not
      presented) to the King and Queen, and the office of Queen's Dresser&mdash;Keeper
      of the Robes was the stately designation of a very humble service&mdash;becoming
      vacant, it was offered to Fanny Burney and accepted by her, acting on the
      advice of her father, who most certainly hoped that his own interests as a
      musician, fully qualified to become leader of the Royal Band, would be
      materially advanced when his daughter should become one of the Household.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reams of indignation have been published from time to time in respect of
      Dr. Burney's conduct in urging on his one brilliant daughter&mdash;the
      others were not brilliant, only mothers&mdash;to accept a post the duties
      of which could be discharged by any lady's maid with far more advantage to
      the Royal Consort than could possibly result from the ministrations of
      Fanny Burney. The world has been called on to bemoan the prudent
      indiscretion of the father, who did not hesitate to fling his gifted
      daughter's pen out of the window, so to speak, and thereby deprive the
      waiting world of some such masterpiece as <i>Camilla</i>&mdash;the novel
      which she published five years after her release from the burden of the
      Robes. There can be no doubt that the feeling which prevailed among the
      circle of the elect&mdash;the Reynoldses, the Burkes, and even the frigid
      Walpole&mdash;when it became known that Miss Burney's health was breaking
      down under the strain of her duties at the Court&mdash;she had about two
      hours' daily attendance of the most ordinary nature upon the Queen&mdash;was
      on the border of indignation. Every one affirmed that it was a disgrace
      for so lively a genius to be kept at the duties of a lady's maid. It was
      like turning the winner of the Oaks out to the plough. Edmund Burke,
      recalling his early approbation of the intentions of Dr. Burney in regard
      to his daughter, declared that he had never made so great a mistake in all
      his life; and we know that he made a few. These excellent people had no
      reason to speak otherwise than they did on this matter. All they knew was
      that the pen of the novelist who had given them so much pleasure had been
      (as they believed) idle for nearly nine years, five of which had been
      passed at the Court. That reflection was quite enough to rouse their
      indignation. But what can one say of the indignation on this point of a
      writer who actually made the fact of his being engaged on a review of the
      Diary of Fanny Burney&mdash;the incomparable Diary which she kept during
      her five years at Court&mdash;an excuse for turning the vials of his wrath
      upon her father, whose obstinacy gave her a chance of writing the most
      interesting chapter&mdash;the most accurate chapter&mdash;of History that
      was ever penned by man or woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      Macaulay wrote in all the fullness of his knowledge of what Fanny Burney
      had written. He knew that for four years after she had published <i>Cecilia</i>
      her pen had been idle so far as fiction was concerned. He knew that for
      five years after her release from the thraldom of the Queen's closet she
      had published nothing; he himself felt it to be his duty to point out the
      comparative worthlessness of <i>Camilla</i>, the novel which she then gave
      to the world, not because she felt upon her the impulse of a woman of
      genius, but simply because she found herself in great need of some ready
      money. Macaulay does not disdain to go into the money question, showing
      (he fancies) how Dr. Burney had by his obstinacy deprived his gifted
      daughter of earning the large sum which she would assuredly have obtained
      by the writing of a novel in the time that she was compelled to devote to
      the Queen's <i>toilette</i>. He found it convenient to ignore the fact
      that of the fourteen years that elapsed between the publication of <i>Cecilia</i>
      and that of <i>Camilla</i> only five were spent at Court. Surely any born
      novelist could, without running a chance of imperilling a well-earned
      reputation by undue haste in the dialogue or by scamping the descriptive
      passages, contrive by dint of hard, but not over-hard, work to produce
      more than one complete romance within a space of nine years. Many ladies
      who are not born novelists have succeeded in surpassing this task without
      physical suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even assuming that the author of <i>Evelina, Cecilia, and Camilla</i>
      lost not only time but money while she was at Court, how much money did
      she lose? She received at least the equivalent of £2000 for her five
      years' service, and she was granted a pension of £100 a year, which she
      drew for forty-nine years; so that for her enforced seclusion she was
      remunerated to the extent of close upon £7000! This sum represents more
      than all Fanny Burney's literary works yielded to her from the joyous
      youthful days of <i>Evelina</i> down to the somewhat sordid middle age of
      <i>Camilla</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what has the world gained by the lamentable short-sightedness
      attributed to Dr. Burney? How is one to estimate the value of that
      incomparable Diary so admirably &ldquo;written up&rdquo; during her tedious five years
      at Court? How many <i>Cecilias</i>, how many <i>Camillas</i> would one not
      give in exchange for a single year of that part of the Diary which deals
      with the approach of the King's malady? In no work of fiction that ever
      came from her pen did she ever show such power of observation, not only of
      incident, but of character as well; nor is there apparent on any page
      produced by her imagination such perfect artistic effects as appeal to a
      reader on every page of this Diary of a disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outset of her account of these dreadful days we are conscious of
      the vague approach of a shadow&mdash;we feel as if we were led into the
      darkened chamber of a haunted house. Our attendant pauses by our side,
      listening for strange noises; she lays a hand upon our arm, as it were,
      and speaks to us in a whisper. We feel that the dread Thing is coming. The
      King is indisposed&mdash;he has not been quite in his usual health for
      some time past; but of course nothing very alarming has been announced by
      Sir George Barker, the Physician in Ordinary, although there is an
      uncertainty as to His Majesty's complaint. But Miss Burney has seen the
      faces of the people about her who have come more closely in contact with
      the Sovereign; she has doubtless noticed the solemnity of some&mdash;the
      airs of mystery, the head-shakings, and she is capable of drawing her own
      conclusions. &ldquo;Heaven preserve him!&rdquo; she whispers in her Diary for October
      19th, 1788. She is very much with the Queen, and she perceives that Her
      Majesty is extremely uneasy, though saying nothing. There is great alarm
      during the night. Possibly some one has heard the delirious voice of the
      King coming from his apartments in that tumbledown palace of his at Kew.
      The fright is general, and every one is wondering what the morning will
      bring forth. Hope comes with the light. The bulletin is that the King was
      ill, but is now so very much better that his physician believes the move
      to Windsor, to which the Court was looking forward, may be taken. The move
      is made on the 25th, and then Miss Burney has a chance meeting with the
      King that causes her to suspect the truth. He talks to her with unnatural
      vehemence&mdash;unnatural volubility&mdash;and without cessation for a
      long time; all is exaggerated, and his graciousness most of all. She has
      never met with anything like this before, but having heard of the delirium
      accompanying a high fever, she believes that His Majesty is in the throes
      of a fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day is Sunday, and she meets him again in one of the passages,
      and she finds him rather more coherent in his talk, but still it is the
      talk of a man in the delirium of a fever. It is all about himself&mdash;his
      health&mdash;his dreadful sleeplessness. He keeps at it for half an hour
      without making the slightest pause; and yet he manages to convey to her an
      impression of his benevolence&mdash;his consideration for the people
      around him&mdash;his hopes that he may not cause them any uneasiness. When
      he leaves her she doubtless tells of the meeting to some of her friends in
      the apartments where the equerries are accustomed to meet, and doubtless
      there are more head-shakings and airs of mystery; but she records: &ldquo;Nobody
      speaks of his illness, nor what they think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, too, no one felt it to be necessary to subject His Majesty to
      any course of treatment, although, a few days later, he became so weak
      that he, who at the beginning of the year thought nothing of walking
      twelve miles at a stretch&mdash;more than his sons could do&mdash;hobbled
      along like a gouty man. Gradually, very gradually, the horror approaches;
      and nothing that has ever been done in fiction equals in effect the simple
      record of all that Fanny Burney noticed from day to day. Most touching of
      all her entries are those relating to the Queen. &ldquo;The Queen,&rdquo; she writes,
      &ldquo;is almost overpowered with some secret terror. I am affected beyond all
      expression in her presence to see what struggles she makes to support her
      serenity. To-day she gave up the conflict when I was alone with her; and
      burst into a violent fit of tears. It was very, very terrible to see!...
      something horrible seemed impending... I was still wholly unsuspicious of
      the greatness of the cause she had for dread. Illness, a breaking up of
      the constitution, the payment of sudden infirmity and premature old age
      for the waste of unguarded health and strength&mdash;these seemed to me
      the threats awaiting her; and great and grievous enough, yet how short of
      the fact!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the terrible truth was revealed. Miss Burney was dining with one
      of the Queen's ladies; but there was little conversation between them. It
      was clear that both had their suspicions of the nature of the dread shadow
      that was hovering over the castle. They remained together, waiting for the
      worst. &ldquo;A stillness the most uncommon reigned over the whole house. Nobody
      stirred; not a voice was heard; not a motion. I could do nothing but
      watch, without knowing for what; there seemed a strangeness in the house
      most extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To talk of such passages as these as examples of literary art would be
      ridiculous. They are transcripts from life itself made by some one with a
      genius for observation, not merely for recording. Boswell had a genius for
      recording; but his powers of observation were on a level with those of a
      sheep. We know perfectly well what his treatment of the scenes leading up
      to the tragedy of the King would have been. But Fanny Burney had the
      artist's instinct for collecting only such incidents as heighten the
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she is still sitting in the dim silence of that November evening with
      her friend some one enters to whisper that there was to be no playing of
      the after-dinner music in which the King usually took so much pleasure.
      Later on the equerries come slowly into the room. There is more whispering&mdash;more
      head-shaking. What was it all about? Had anything happened? What had
      happened? No one wishes to be the first to speak. But the suspense! The
      strain upon the nerves of the two ladies! At last it can be borne no
      longer. The dreadful revelation is made. The King is a madman!
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner, the Prince of Wales being present, His Majesty had &ldquo;broken
      forth into positive delirium, which long had been menacing all who saw him
      most closely; and the Queen was so overpowered as to fall into violent
      hysterics. All the princesses were in misery, and the Prince of Wales had
      burst into tears. No one knew what was to follow&mdash;no one could
      conjecture the event.&rdquo; Nothing could be more pathetic than the concern of
      the King for his wife. His delusion is that she is the sufferer. When
      Fanny Burney went to her room, where she was accustomed to await her
      nightly summons to attend Her Majesty, she remained there alone for two
      hours. At midnight she can stand the suspense no longer. She opens the
      door and listens in the passage. Not a sound is to be heard. Not even a
      servant crossed the stairs on the corridor off which her apartment opened.
      After another hour's suspense a page knocks at her door with the message
      that she is to go at once to her Royal mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Royal Mistress!&rdquo; she writes. &ldquo;Never can I forget her countenance&mdash;pale,
      ghastly pale she looked... her whole frame was disordered, yet she was
      still and quiet. And the poor King is dreadfully uneasy about her. Nothing
      was the matter with himself, he affirmed, except nervousness on her
      account. He insisted on having a bed made up for himself in her
      dressing-room in order that he might be at hand should she become worse
      through the night. He had given orders that Miss Goldsworthy was to remain
      with her; but it seemed that he had no great confidence in the vigilance
      of any one but himself, for some hours after the Queen had retired he
      appeared before the eyes of the horrified lady-in-waiting, at the door,
      bearing a lighted candle. He opened the bed curtains and satisfied himself
      that his dread of her being carried out of the palace was unfounded; but
      he did not leave the room for another half-hour, and the terror of the
      scene completely overwhelmed the unhappy lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truly when this terror was walking by night Fanny Burney's stipend was
      well earned. But worse was in store for her when it was decided that the
      King should be removed to Kew Palace, which he detested and which was
      certainly the most miserable of all the miserable dwelling-places of the
      Royal Family. It seemed to be nobody's business to make any preparation
      for the reception of the Queen and her entourage. The rooms were dirty and
      unwarmed, and the corridors were freezing. And to the horrors of this
      damp, unsavoury barrack was added Mrs. Schwellenberg, the German
      she-dragon who had done her best to make Fanny Burney's life unendurable
      during the previous three years. Formerly Fanny had dwelt upon the
      ill-treatment she had received at the hands of this old harridan; but now
      she only refers to her as an additional element of casual discomfort. The
      odious creature is &ldquo;so oppressed between her spasms and the house's
      horrors, that the oppression she inflicted ought perhaps to be pardoned.
      It was, however, difficult enough to bear,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;Harshness, tyranny,
      dissension, and even insult seemed personified. I cut short details upon
      this subject&mdash;they would but make you sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truly little Miss Burney earned her wages at this time. The dilapidated
      palace was only rendered habitable by the importation of a cartload of
      sandbags, which were as strategically distributed for the exclusion of the
      draughts as if they were the usual defensive supply of a siege. But even
      this ingenious device failed to neutralise the Arctic rigours of the
      place. The providing of carpets for some of the bare floors of the
      bedrooms and passages was a startling innovation; but eventually it was
      carried out. An occasional set of curtains also was smuggled into this
      frozen fairy palace, and a sofa came now and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of all these auxiliaries to luxury&mdash;in spite, too, of
      Mrs. Schwellenberg's having locked herself into her room, forbidding any
      one to disturb her&mdash;the dreariness and desolation of the December at
      Kew must have caused Miss Burney to think with longing of the comforts of
      her father's home in St. Martin's Street and of the congenial atmosphere
      which she breathed during her numerous visits to the Thrales' solid
      mansion at Streatham.

    <p>
      The condition of the King was becoming worse, and early whispers of the
      necessity for a Regency grew louder. It was understood that Mrs.
      Fitzherbert would be made a duchess! Everybody outside the palace sought
      to stand well in the estimation of the Prince of Wales, and Pitt was
      pointed out as a traitor to his country because he did his best to
      postpone the Comus orgy which every one knew would follow the establishing
      of a Regency. The appointment of the Doctors Willis was actually referred
      to as a shocking impiety, suggesting as it did a wicked rebellion against
      the decree of the Almighty, Who, according to Burke, had hurled the
      monarch from his throne. There were, however, some who did not regard Mr.
      Burke as an infallible judge on such a point, and no one was more
      indignant at the mouthings of the rhetorician than Miss Burney. But it
      seemed as if the approach of the Regency could no longer be retarded. The
      Willises were unable to certify to any improvement in the condition of the
      King during the month of January, 1789. It was really not until he had
      that chase after Fanny Burney in Kew Gardens that a change for the better
      came about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she was greatly terrified by his affectionate salutation, she could
      not but have been surprised at the sanity displayed in the monologue that
      followed; for one of the first of his innumerable questions revealed to
      her the fact that he was perfectly well aware of what a trial to her
      patience was the odious Mrs. Schwellenberg. He asked how she was getting
      on with Mrs. Schwellenberg, and he did so with a laugh that showed her how
      well he appreciated her difficulties in this direction in the past. Before
      she could say a word he was making light of the Schwellenberg&mdash;adopting
      exactly the strain that he knew would be most effective with Miss Burney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind her&mdash;never mind her! Don't be oppressed! I am your
      friend! Don't let her cast you down&mdash;I know that you have a hard time
      of it&mdash;but don't mind her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advice and the tone in which it was given&mdash;with a pleasant laugh&mdash;did
      not seem very consistent with what she expected from a madman. Fanny
      Burney appears up to that moment to have been under the impression that
      the King and Queen had known nothing of the tyranny and the insults to
      which she had been subjected by Mrs. Schwellenberg. But now it was made
      plain to her that the eyes of the Royal couple had been open all the time.
      If Macaulay had noticed the passage touching upon this point he would have
      had still stronger grounds for his attack upon their Majesties for their
      want of consideration for the tire-woman who was supposed never to be
      tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how much more surprised must Fanny Burney have been when the King went
      on to talk to her in the most cordially confidential way about her father!
      It must have been another revelation to her when he showed how fully he
      realised the ambitions of Dr. Burney. He asked her regarding the progress
      of the <i>History of Music</i>, at which Dr. Burney had been engaged for
      several years, and this gave him a chance of getting upon his favourite
      topic, the music of Handel. But when he began to illustrate some of his
      impressions on this fruitful theme by singing over the choruses of an
      oratorio or two&mdash;perhaps such trifles as &ldquo;All we like Sheep,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;Lift up your Heads,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo;&mdash;he must have gone far
      toward neutralising the good opinion she had formed as to his sanity.
      Fortunately the attendant doctors interposed at this point; but the fact
      that the distinguished amateur suffered their adverse criticism proves to
      posterity that the King was even more good-natured than he had been
      painted by Miss Burney.
    </p>
    <p>
      On then he went to talk of the subject which must never have been far from
      Dr. Burney's heart&mdash;the Mastership of the King's Band: &ldquo;Your father
      ought to have had the post, and not that little poor musician Parsons, who
      was not fit for it,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But Lord Salisbury used your father very
      ill in that business, and so he did me! However, I have dashed out his
      name, and I shall put your father's in&mdash;as soon as I get loose again.
      What has your father got at last? Nothing but that poor thing at Chelsea!
      Oh, fie! fie! But never mind! I will take care of him&mdash;I will do it
      myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Could he have given the devoted daughter of Dr. Burney a more emphatic
      proof of his complete recovery to sanity than this? Why, it would have
      convinced Dr. Burney himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! although the King may have been very resolute at the moment&mdash;he
      had just been making out a list of new officers of State, and was ready to
      show her that the name of her father's enemy, Lord Salisbury, was not to
      be found in it, and he assured her that in future he would rule with a rod
      of iron&mdash;yet before he returned to his ordinary way of life he must
      have mislaid his list, for poor Dr. Burney remained at his post of
      organist of Chelsea Hospital. He never attained to the place which he
      coveted and for which his daughter was sent to five years' Royal
      servitude, and (incidentally) to achieve for herself that immortality as a
      chronicler which would certainly never have been won by her as a novelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the King did not confine his conversation to the one topic which he
      knew was of greatest interest to her. He spoke of Mrs. Delany, who had
      been the means of introducing Fanny to the Royal circle; and he referred
      to the ill-treatment which he had received at the hands of one of his
      pages; but this was the only passage that savoured of unkindness, and the
      chronicler is unable to do more than hope that the conduct of the pages
      was one of His Majesty's delusions. Then, with what seems to us to be
      consummate adroitness, he put some questions to her which she could not
      but answer. &ldquo;They referred to information given to him in his illness from
      various motives, but which he suspected to be false, and which I knew he
      had reason to suspect,&rdquo; Miss Burney writes. &ldquo;Yet was it most dangerous to
      set anything right, as I was not aware what might be the views of their
      having been stated wrong. I was as discreet as I knew how to be, and I
      hope I did no mischief: but this was the worst part of the dialogue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We can quite believe that it was, and considering that it was the part of
      the dialogue which was most interesting to the King, we think that Miss
      Burney was to be congratulated upon the tact she displayed in her answers.
      She did not cause the King to be more perturbed than he was when waxing
      indignant over the conduct of his pages; and there was no need for Dr.
      Willis to interfere at this point, though he did a little later on. Then
      submitting with the utmost docility to the control of his excellent
      attendant, and with another exhortation not to pay any attention to the
      whims of the Schwellenberg, the gracious gentleman kissed her once more on
      the cheek and allowed her to take her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended this remarkable adventure in Kew Gardens. One can picture Fanny
      Burney flying to tell the Queen all that had occurred&mdash;to repeat
      everything that her discretion permitted her of the conversation; and one
      has no difficulty in imagining the effect upon Queen Charlotte of all that
      she narrated; but it seems rather hard that from Mrs. Schwellenberg should
      have been withheld the excellent advice given by the King to Miss Burney
      respecting the German virago.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been impossible either for Fanny Burney or the Queen to come
      to any conclusion from all that happened except one that was entirely
      satisfactory to both. King George III was undoubtedly on the high road to
      recovery, and subsequent events confirmed this opinion. It really seemed
      that the interview with the author of <i>Evelina</i> marked the
      turning-point in his malady at this time. Every day brought its record of
      improvement, and within a fortnight the dreaded Regency Bill, which had
      been sent up to the Lords, was abandoned. On March 1st there were public
      thanksgivings in all the churches, followed by such an illumination of
      London as had not been seen since the great fire. The scene at Kew is
      admirably described by Miss Burney, who had written some congratulatory
      lines to be offered by the Princess Amelia to the King. A great
      &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; had been painted by the Queen's order, representing the
      King, Providence, Health, and Britannia&mdash;a truly British tableau&mdash;and
      when this was hung out and illuminated the little Princess &ldquo;went to lead
      her papa to the front window.&rdquo; Then she dropped on her knees and gave him
      the &ldquo;copy of verses,&rdquo; with the postscript:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The little bearer begs a kiss
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      From dear papa for bringing this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;dear papa&rdquo; took his dear child in his arms, and held her close to him
      for some time. Nothing could have been more charmingly natural and
      affecting. For such a picture of Royalty at home we are indebted to Fanny
      Burney, and, face to face with it, we are selfish enough to feel grateful
      to Dr. Burney for having given his daughter for five years to discharge a
      humble duty to her Sovereign and an immortal one to her fellow-countrymen,
      who have read her Diary and placed it on a shelf between Pepys and de
      Gramont.

    <h2>
      A COMEDY IN ST. MARTIN'S STREET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>R BURNEY was
      giving a &ldquo;command&rdquo; party at his house in St. Martin's Street, Leicester
      Fields&mdash;the house which Sir Isaac Newton did once inhabit, and which
      was still crowned with the most celebrated observatory in Europe. In the
      early years of his musical career he had had a patron, Mr. Fulk Greville,
      who had done a great deal for him, and in later days he had never quite
      forgotten this fact, although Dr. Burney had climbed high on the
      professional as well as the social ladder, and was better known in the
      world than Mr. Greville himself. He had become quite intimate with many
      great persons and several curious ones. It is uncertain whether Mr.
      Greville regarded Dr. Johnson as belonging to the former or the latter
      class, but at any rate he had heard a great deal about Dr. Johnson, and
      did not think that, provided he took every reasonable precaution, any harm
      could come to himself from meeting such a notability. He accordingly
      instructed Dr. Burney to bring him and Johnson together, and Burney
      promised to do so. Before the day for this meeting was fixed Mrs. Greville&mdash;who,
      by the way, was Fanny Burney's godmother&mdash;had signified her intention
      of viewing the huge person also, and of bringing her daughter, the
      exquisite Mrs. Crewe, to attend the promised exhibition of genius in bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Dr. Johnson was ready to lend himself to any plan that might be
      devised to increase the circumference of his circle of admirers, and
      besides, this Mr. Fulk Greville was a descendant of the friend of Sir
      Philip Sidney, and had large possessions, as well as a magnificent country
      seat, and altogether he would make a most desirable listener; so he agreed
      to come to the party to be inspected by the Greville family. Burney,
      however, wishing, as every responsible proprietor of a menagerie should
      wish, to be on the safe side and exhibit his bear under the eye and the
      controlling influence of his favourite keeper, invited Mr. and Mrs. Thrale
      to the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were to be the &ldquo;principals&rdquo; in the comedy of this entertainment; and
      for the subordinates he selected his married daughter and her husband&mdash;both
      admirable musicians&mdash;Mr. Davenant, Mr. Seward, and a certain Italian
      musician, a vocalist as well as a performer on the violin and that new
      instrument which was at first called the fortepiano, then the pianoforte,
      and later on simply the piano. This person's name was Gabrielli Piozzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the harmonious elements which Dr. Burney proposed to bring
      together for the gratification of Mr. Fulk Greville and his wife. Mr.
      Greville was an amateur of some little capacity, and he had certainly at
      one time been greatly interested in music. He had paid £300 to Burney's
      master, the celebrated Dr. Arne, who composed in the masque of &ldquo;Alfred&rdquo;
       the rousing anthem known as &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; for the cancelling of
      Burney's indentures as an apprentice to the &ldquo;art of musick,&rdquo; and had taken
      the young man into his own house in a capacity which may best be described
      as that of entertaining secretary. Dr. Burney may therefore have thought
      in his wisdom that, should Johnson be in one of his bearish moods and feel
      disinclined to exhibit his parts of speech to Mr. Greville, the latter
      would be certain of entertainment from the musicians. This showed
      forethought and a good working knowledge of Dr. Johnson. But in spite of
      the second string to the musician's bow the party was a fiasco&mdash;that
      is, from the standpoint of a social entertainment; it included one
      incident, however, which made it the most notable of the many of the
      Burney parties of which a record remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what records there are available to any one interested in the
      entertainments given by Dr. Burney and his charming family at that modest
      house of theirs, just round the corner from Sir Joshua Reynolds' larger
      establishment in Leicester Fields! Hundreds of people who contributed to
      make the second half of the eighteenth century the most notable of any
      period so far as literature and the arts were concerned, since the
      spacious days of Elizabeth, were accustomed to meet together informally at
      this house, and to have their visits recorded for all ages to muse upon.
      To that house came Garrick, not to exhibit his brilliance as a talker
      before a crowd of admirers, but to entertain the children of the household
      with the buffooning that never flagged, and that never fell short of
      genius in any exhibition. He was the delight of the schoolroom. Edmund
      Burke and his brother, both fond of conversation when oratory was not
      available, were frequently here; Reynolds came with many of his sitters,
      and found fresh faces for his canvas among his fellow-guests; and with him
      came his maiden sister, feeling herself more at home with the simple
      Burney circle than she ever did with the company who assembled almost
      daily under her brother's roof. Nollekens, the sculptor; Colman, the
      dramatist and theatre manager, who was obliged to run away from London to
      escape the gibes which were flung at him from every quarter when
      Goldsmith's <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, which he had done his best to
      make a failure, became the greatest success of the year; Cumberland, the
      embittered rival of Goldsmith, who was the person who gave the solitary
      hiss during the first performance of the same play, causing the timid
      author to say to the manager on entering the playhouse, &ldquo;What is that, sir&mdash;pray,
      what is that? Is it a hiss?&rdquo; To which Colman replied, &ldquo;Psha! sir, what
      signifies a squib when we have been sitting on a barrel of gunpowder all
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were among the notabilities; and the &ldquo;curiosities&rdquo; were quite as
      numerous. The earliest of Arctic voyagers, Sir Constantine Phipps, who
      later became Lord Mulgrave, put in an appearance at more than one of the
      parties; and so did Omai, the &ldquo;gentle savage&rdquo; of the poet Cowper, who was
      brought by Captain Cook from the South Seas in the ship on which young
      Burney was an officer. The sisters, who, of course, idolised the sailor,
      sat open-mouthed with wonder to hear their brother chatting away to Omai
      in his native language. Upon another occasion came Bruce, the Abyssinian
      traveller, who told the story of how steaks were cut from the live ox when
      needed by the inhabitants of one region. He was immensely tall, as were
      some of his stories; but though extremely dignified, he did not object to
      a practical joke. Another person of great stature who visited the Burneys
      was the notorious Count Orloff, the favourite of the Empress Catherine of
      Russia; and from the letters of one of the young people of the household
      one has no difficulty in perceiving with what interest he was regarded by
      the girls, especially since the report reached them that he had personally
      strangled his imperial master at the instigation of his imperial mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are but, a few names out of the many on the Burneys' visiting list.
      Of course, as regards musical artists, the house was the rendezvous of the
      greatest in London. While the opera-house in the Haymarket was open there
      was a constant flow of brilliant vocalists to these shores, and the young
      people had many opportunities of becoming acquainted with the ignorance,
      the capriciousness, the affectations, and the abilities which were to be
      found associated with the lyric stage in the eighteenth century, as they
      are in the twentieth. Among the prime donne who sang for the Burneys were
      the Agujari&mdash;a marvellous performer, who got fifty pounds for every
      song she sang at the Pantheon&mdash;and her great but uncertain rival,
      Gabrielli. The former, according to Mozart, who may possibly be allowed to
      be something of a judge, had a vocal range which was certainly never
      equalled by any singer before or after his time. She won all hearts and a
      great deal of money during her visit to London, and she left with the
      reputation of being the most marvellous and most rapacious of Italians.
      Gabrielli seems to have tried to make up by capriciousness what she lacked
      in expression. Her voice was, so far as can be gathered from contemporary
      accounts, small and thin. But by judiciously disappointing the public she
      became the most widely talked of vocalist in the country. Then among the
      men were the simple and gracious Pacchierotti&mdash;who undoubtedly became
      attached to Fanny Burney&mdash;Rauzzini, and Piozzi.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0049.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The Burneys' house was for years the centre of the highest intellectual
      entertainment to be found in London, and the tact of the head of the
      household, and the simple, natural manners of his daughters, usually
      succeeded in preventing the intrusion of a single inharmonious note, in
      spite of the fact that a Welsh harpist named Jones had once been among the
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But upon the occasion of this &ldquo;command&rdquo; party, when Greville was to meet
      Johnson, and the latter had dressed himself with that extreme care which
      we suspect meant that he tied up his hose, and put on a wig the front of
      which had not yet been burnt away by coming in contact with his lighted
      candle, Burney's tact overreached itself. Mr. Greville may have felt that
      the Thrales had no business to be of the party, or Johnson may have gained
      the impression that Burney's old patron was anxious to play the same part,
      in an honorary sort of way, in regard to himself. At any rate, he refused
      to be drawn out to exhibit his conversational powers to a supercilious
      visitor; and after a brief space of time he turned his back upon every one
      and his face to the fire, and there he sat, greatly to the discomfiture,
      no doubt, of his host. In a very short time a gloom settled down upon the
      whole party. Mr. Thrale, stiff and reserved, was not the man to pull
      things together. He sat mute on his chair, making no advance toward Mr.
      Greville, and Mr. Greville had probably his chin in the air, having come
      to the conclusion that Dr. Johnson's powers as a conversationalist had
      been greatly overrated by rumour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when all hope of sociability had vanished that Dr. Burney, who,
      when a church organist, may have had occasion to cover up the shortcomings
      of the clergyman by a timely voluntary, begged Signor Piozzi to oblige the
      company with a song. But Piozzi was a forlorn hope. He was the last man in
      the world to save the situation. Had he been a vocalist of the calibre of
      Pacchierotti he could have made no headway against the funereal gloom that
      had settled down upon the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Piozzi had a sweet and highly trained voice, though some years earlier he
      had lost its best notes, and he sang with exquisite expression; but when
      playing his own accompaniment, with his back turned to his audience, he
      was prone to exaggerate the sentiment of the music until sentiment became
      lost in an exuberance of sentimentality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style of singing is not that to which any one would resort in order
      to dissipate a sudden social gloom. As the singer went on the gloom
      deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at this moment that one of those ironic little imps that lurk
      in wainscot nooks looking out for an opportunity to influence an
      unconscious human being to an act which the little demon, seeing the end
      of a scene of which mortals only see the beginning, regards with sardonic
      glee, whispered something in the ear of Mrs. Thrale, and in an instant, in
      obedience to its prompting, she had left her chair and stolen behind the
      singer at the piano. Raising her hands and turning up her eyes in
      imitation of Piozzi, she indulged in a piece of mimicry which must have
      shocked every one in the room except the singer, who had his back to her,
      and Dr. Johnson, who, besides being too short-sighted to be able to see
      her, was gazing into the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt the flippant little lady felt that a touch of farcical fun was
      the very thing needed to make the party go with a snap; but such flagrant
      bad taste as was involved in the transaction was more than Dr. Burney
      could stand. Keeping his temper marvellously well in hand, considering his
      provocation, he went gently behind the gesticulating woman and put a stop
      to her fooling. Shaking his head, he whispered in a &ldquo;half joke whole
      earnest&rdquo; way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, madam, you have no ear yourself for music, will you destroy the
      attention of all who, in that one point, are otherwise gifted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Or words to that effect, it might be safe to add, for the phrases as
      recorded in the diary of one of his daughters are a trifle too academic
      for even Dr. Burney to have whispered on the spur of the moment. But he
      certainly reproved the lady, and she took his remonstrance in good part,
      and showed herself to be admirably appreciative of the exact pose to
      assume in order to save the situation. She went demurely to her chair and
      sat there stiffly, and with the affectation of a schoolgirl who has been
      admonished for a fault and commanded to take a seat in silence and apart
      from the rest of the class. It must be apparent to every one that this was
      the precise attitude for her to strike in the circumstances, and that she
      was able to perceive this in a rather embarrassing moment shows that Mrs.
      Thrale was quite as clever as her friends made her out to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      But regarding the incident itself, surely the phrase, &ldquo;the irony of fate,&rdquo;
       was invented to describe it. A better illustration of the sport of
      circumstance could not be devised, for in the course of time the lively
      little lady, who had gone as far as any one could go in making a mock of
      another, had fallen as deep in love with the man whom she mocked as ever
      Juliet did with her Romeo. She found that she could not live without him,
      and, sacrificing friends, position, and fortune, she threw herself into
      his arms, and lived happy ever after.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of the first scene in this saturnine comedy which was being
      enacted in the drawing-room in that house in St. Martin's Street, was in
      perfect keeping with the <i>mise-en-scène</i> constructed by Fate, taking
      the rôle of Puck. It is admirably described in the diary of Charlotte
      Burney. She wrote that Mr. Greville&mdash;whom she nicknamed &ldquo;Mr. Gruel&rdquo;&mdash;assumed
      &ldquo;his most supercilious air of distant superiority&rdquo; and &ldquo;planted himself
      immovable as a noble statue upon the hearth, as if a stranger to the whole
      set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Dr. Johnson must have had enough of the fire at which he had
      been sitting, and we at once see how utterly hopeless were the social
      relations at this miserable party when we hear that the men &ldquo;were so kind
      and considerate as to divert themselves by making a fire-screen to the
      whole room.&rdquo; But Dr. Johnson, having thoroughly warmed himself, was now in
      a position to administer a rebuke to the less fortunate ones, and, when
      nobody would have imagined that he had known the gentlemen were in the
      room, he said that &ldquo;if he was not ashamed he would keep the fire from the
      ladies too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This reproof (for a reproof it certainly was, although given in a very
      comical, dry way) was productive,&rdquo; Charlotte adds, &ldquo;of a scene as good as
      a comedy, for Mr. Suard tumbled on to a sopha directly, Mr. Thrale on to a
      chair, Mr. Davenant sneaked off the premises, seemingly in as great a
      fright and as much confounded as if he had done any bad action, and Mr.
      Gruel being left solus, was obliged to stalk off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A more perfect description of the &ldquo;curtain&rdquo; to the first act of this, &ldquo;as
      good as a comedy,&rdquo; could not be imagined. In every scene of this memorable
      evening the mocking figure of an impish Fate can be discerned. There was
      the tactful and urbane Dr. Burney anxious to gratify his old patron by
      presenting to him the great Dr. Johnson, and at the same time to show on
      what excellent terms he himself was with the family of the wealthy brewer,
      Mr. Thrale. Incidentally he has caused Johnson to put himself to the
      inconvenience of a clean shirt and a respectable wig; and, like a
      thoughtful general, lest any of his plans should fall short of fulfilment,
      he has invited an interesting vocalist to cover up the retreat and make
      failure almost impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Burney could do wonders by the aid of his tact and urbanity, but he is
      no match for Fate playing the part of Puck. Within an hour Johnson has
      disappointed him and become grumpy&mdash;the old bear has found the buns
      to be stale; Mr. Greville, the patron, is in a patronising mood, and
      becomes stiff and aloof because Johnson, secure with his pension, resents
      it; Mrs. Thrale, anxious to do her best for Burney, and at the same time
      to show Mrs. Greville and her fine daughter how thoroughly at home she is
      in the house and how delicate is her sense of humour, strikes an
      appallingly false note, and only saves herself by a touch of cleverness
      from appearing wholly ridiculous. This is pretty well for the opening
      scenes, but the closing catastrophe is not long delayed. The men huddle
      themselves together in stony silence; and they are reproved for
      impoliteness by&mdash;whom? Dr. Johnson, the man who has studied
      boorishness and advanced it to a place among the arts&mdash;the man who
      calls those who differ from him dolts and fools and rascals&mdash;the man
      whose manners at the dinner table are those of the sty and trough&mdash;the
      man who walks about the streets ungartered and unclean&mdash;this is the
      man who has the effrontery to rebuke for their rudeness such gentlemen as
      Mr. Fulk Greville, Mr. Seward, and Mr. Thrale! Puck can go no further.
      Down comes the curtain when one gentleman collapses upon a &ldquo;sopha,&rdquo;
       another into a chair, a third sneaks off like a culprit, and the fourth
      stalks off with an air of offended dignity!
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be thought that the imp of mischief who had assumed the control
      of this evening's entertainment would be satisfied at the result of his
      pranks so far. Nothing of the sort. He was only satisfied when he had made
      a match between the insignificant figure who was playing the musical
      accompaniment to his pranks and the lady who thought that his presence in
      the room was only justifiable on the ground that he made an excellent butt
      for her mockery!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the funniest part of the whole comedy is to be found in the fact that
      the pair lived happy ever after!
    </p>
    <p>
      The extraordinary influence which Boswell has had upon almost every
      student of the life of the latter half of the eighteenth century is shown
      in a marked way by the general acceptance of his view&mdash;which it is
      scarcely necessary to say was Johnson's view&mdash;of the second marriage
      of Mrs. Thrale. We are treating Boswell much more fairly than he treated
      Mrs. Thrale when we acknowledge at once that his opinion was shared by a
      considerable number of the lady's friends, including Dr. Burney and his
      family. They were all shocked when they heard that the widow of the
      Southwark brewer had married the Italian musician, Signor Gabrielli
      Piozzi. Even in the present day, when one might reasonably expect that,
      the miserable pettiness of Boswell's character having been made apparent,
      his judgment on most points would be received with a smile, he is taken
      very seriously by a good many people. It has long ago been made plain that
      Boswell was quite unscrupulous in his treatment of every one that crossed
      his path or made an attempt to interfere with the aim of his life, which
      was to become the biographer of Johnson. The instances of his petty
      malevolence which have come to light within recent years are innumerable.
      They show that the opinion which his contemporaries formed of him was
      absolutely correct. We know that he was regarded as a cur who was ever at
      Johnson's heels, and took the insults of the great man with a fawning
      complacency that was pathetically canine. He was daily called a cur. &ldquo;Oh,
      no,&rdquo; said Goldsmith, &ldquo;he is not a cur, only a burr; Tom Davies flung him
      at Johnson one day as a joke, and he stuck to him ever since&rdquo;&mdash;a cur,
      and an ape and a spy and a Branghton&mdash;the last by Dr. Johnson himself
      in the presence of a large company, that included the creator of the
      contemptible Mr. Branghton. (The incident was not, however, recorded by
      Mr. Boswell himself.) But as the extraordinary interest in his <i>Life of
      Johnson</i> began to be acknowledged, the force of contemporary opinion
      gradually dwindled away, until Boswell's verdicts and Boswell's inferences
      found general acceptance; and even now Goldsmith is regarded as an Irish
      <i>omadhaum</i>, because Boswell did his best to make him out to be one,
      and Mrs. Thrale is thought to have forfeited her claims to respect because
      she married Signor Piozzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      People forget the origin of Boswell's malevolence in both cases. He
      detested Goldsmith because Goldsmith was a great writer, who was capable
      of writing a great biography of Johnson, with whom he had been on the most
      intimate terms long before Tom Davies flung his burr at Johnson; he hated
      Baretti and recorded&mdash;at the sacrifice of Johnson's reputation for
      humanity&mdash;Johnson's cynical belittling of him, because he feared that
      Baretti would write <i>the</i> biography; he was spiteful in regard to
      Mrs. Thrale because she actually did write something biographical about
      Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impudence of such a man as Boswell writing about &ldquo;honest Dr.
      Goldsmith&rdquo; is only surpassed by his allusions to the second marriage of
      Mrs. Thrale. He was a fellow-guest with Johnson at the Thrales' house in
      1775, and he records something of a conversation which he says occurred on
      the subject of a woman's marrying some one greatly beneath her socially.
      &ldquo;When I recapitulate the debate,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and recollect what has since
      happened, I cannot but be struck in a manner that delicacy forbids me to
      express! While I contended that she ought to be treated with inflexible
      steadiness of displeasure, Mrs. Thrale was all for mildness and
      forgiveness and, according to the vulgar phrase, making the best of a bad
      bargain.&rdquo; This was published after the second marriage. What would be
      thought of a modern biographer who should borrow a little of Boswell's
      &ldquo;delicacy,&rdquo; and refer to a similar incident in the same style?
    </p>
    <p>
      In his own inimitable small way Boswell was for ever sneering at Mrs.
      Thrale. Sometimes he did it with that scrupulous delicacy of which an
      example has just been given; but he called her a liar more than once with
      considerable indelicacy, and his readers will without much trouble come to
      the conclusion that his indelicacy was preferable to his delicacy&mdash;it
      certainly came more natural to him. He was small and mean in all his ways,
      and never smaller or meaner than in his references to Mrs. Thrale's second
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it must be repeated, he did not stand alone in regarding her union
      with Piozzi as a <i>mésalliance</i>. Dr. Burney was shocked at the thought
      that any respectable woman would so far forget herself as to marry a
      musician, and his daughter Fanny wept remorseful tears when she reflected
      that she had once been the friend of a lady who did not shrink from
      marrying a foreigner and a Roman Catholic&mdash;more of the irony of Fate,
      for Fanny Burney was herself guilty of the same indiscretion later on: she
      made a happy marriage with a Roman Catholic foreigner, who lived on her
      pension and her earnings. Dr. Johnson was brutal when the conviction was
      forced upon him that he would no longer have an opportunity of insulting a
      lady who had treated him with incredible kindness, or the guests whom he
      met at her table. Upon one of the last occasions of his dining at Mrs.
      Thrale's house at Streatham, a gentleman present&mdash;an inoffensive
      Quaker&mdash;ventured to make a remark respecting the accuracy with which
      the red-hot cannon-balls were fired at the Siege of Gibraltar. Johnson
      listened for some time, and then with a cold sneer said, &ldquo;I would advise
      you, sir, never to relate this story again. You really can scarce imagine
      how very poor a figure you make in the telling of it.&rdquo; Later on he took
      credit to himself for not quarrelling with his victim when the latter
      chose to talk to his brother rather than to the man who had insulted him.
      Yes, it can quite easily be understood that Johnson should look on the
      marriage as a sad <i>mésalliance</i>, and possibly it is fair to assume
      from the letter which he wrote to the lady that he felt hurt when he heard
      that it was to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale wrote to tell him that she meant to marry Piozzi, and received
      the following reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&mdash;If I interpret your letter right, you are ignominiously
      married; if it is yet undone, let us once more talk together. If you have
      abandoned your children and your religion, God forgive your wickedness; if
      you have forfeited your fame and your country, may your folly do no
      further mischief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Possibly the lady may have gathered from the hint or two conveyed to her,
      with Boswellian delicacy, in this letter, that Johnson was displeased with
      her. At any rate, she replied, declining to continue the correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her letter she summed up the situation exactly as a reasonable person,
      acquainted with all the facts, and knowing something of the first husband,
      would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The birth of my second husband is not meaner than that of my first,&rdquo; she
      wrote; &ldquo;his sentiments are not meaner; his profession is not meaner; and
      his superiority in what he professes acknowledged by all mankind. It is
      want of fortune, then, that is ignominious; the character of the man I
      have chosen has no other claim to such an epithet. The religion to which
      he has always been a zealous adherent, will, I hope, teach him to forgive
      insults he has not deserved; mine will, I hope, enable [me] to bear them
      at once with dignity and patience. To hear that I have forfeited my fame
      is indeed the greatest insult I ever yet received. My fame is as unsullied
      as snow, or I should think it unworthy of him who must henceforth protect
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought the surly burly mass of offended dignity to his proper level;
      but still he would not offer the lady who had been his benefactress for
      twenty years an apology for his brutality. He had the presumption to offer
      his advice instead&mdash;advice and the story (highly appropriate from his
      point of view) of Mary Queen of Scots and the Archbishop of St. Andrews.
      He advised her to remain in England&mdash;he would not relinquish his room
      in her house and his place at her table without a struggle&mdash;as her
      rank would be higher in England than in Italy, and her fortune would be
      under her own eye. The latter suggestion was a delicate insult to Piozzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi, as she then became, showed that she esteemed this piece of
      presumption, under the guise of advice, at its true value. Immediately
      after her marriage she went abroad with her husband, though eventually she
      settled with him in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, most modern readers will, we think, when they have become acquainted
      with the whole story of Mrs. Thrale's life, arrive at the conclusion that
      it was her first marriage that was the <i>mésalliance</i>, not her second.

      Henry Thrale was a man of humble origin&mdash;a fact that revealed itself
      almost daily in his life&mdash;and he was incapable of loving any one
      except himself. He certainly never made a pretence of devotion to his
      wife, and it is equally certain that, although she did more for him than
      any other woman would have done, she never loved him. It might be going
      too far, considering the diversity of temperament existing among
      womankind, to assert that he was incapable of being loved by any woman;
      but beyond a doubt he was not a lovable man. He was a stiff, dignified,
      morose, uncongenial man, and he was a Member of Parliament into the
      bargain. What could a pretty, lively, brilliant girl of good family see in
      such a man as Thrale to make her love him? She never did love him&mdash;at
      times she must have detested him. But she married him, and it was a lucky
      day for him that she did so. Twice she saved him from bankruptcy, and
      three times she induced his constituents, who thoroughly hated him, to
      return him to Parliament as their representative. He never did anything in
      Parliament, and he did little out of it that was worth remembering. It is
      customary to make large allowances for a man of business who finds that
      his wealth and a charming wife serve as a passport into what is called
      society, though latterly such men do not stand in need of such a favour
      being shown to them. But if a man betrays his ignorance of certain social
      usages&mdash;not necessarily refinements&mdash;his friends excuse him on
      the ground that he is a first-rate business man. Thrale, however, was
      unworthy of such a title. He inherited a great scientific business, but he
      showed himself so incapable of appreciating the methods by which it had
      been built up, that he brought himself within a week or two of absolute
      ruin by listening to a clumsy adventurer who advocated the adoption of a
      system of adulteration of his beer that even a hundred and fifty years ago
      would have brought him within sight of a criminal prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      His literary wife, by her clever management, aided by the money of her
      mother and of sundry of her own, not her husband's, friends, succeeded in
      staving off the threatened disaster. But the pig-headed man did not accept
      the lesson which one might imagine he would have learned. Seeing the
      success that crowned other enterprises of the same character as his own,
      he endeavoured to emulate this success, not by the legitimate way of
      increasing his customers, but by the idiotic plan of over-production. He
      had an idea that in the multiplying of the article which he had to sell he
      was increasing his business. Once again he was helped from the verge of
      ruin by his literary wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have been a dreadful trial to her, and to a far-seeing manager
      whom he had&mdash;a man named Perkins. Of course it was inevitable that
      the force of character possessed by this Mr. Perkins must eventually
      prevail against the dignified incompetence of the proprietor. The
      inevitable happened, and the name of Perkins has for more than a hundred
      years been bracketed with Barclay as a going concern, while the name of
      Thrale has vanished for ever from &ldquo;the Borough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was this Mr. Perkins who, when the brewery was within five minutes of
      absolute disaster, displayed the tactics of a great general in the face of
      an implacable enemy, and saved the property. As a reward for his services
      his master authorised the presentation to him of the sum of a hundred
      pounds. His master's wife, however, being a more generous assessor of the
      value of the man's ability, ventured to present double the sum, together
      with a silver tea-service for Mrs. Perkins; but she did so in fear and
      trembling, failing to summon up sufficient courage to acquaint her husband
      with her extravagance until further concealment was impossible. She was so
      overjoyed at his sanctioning the increase that she at once wrote to her
      friends acquainting them with this evidence of his generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This episode was certainly the most stirring in the history of Thrale's
      brewery. The Gordon rioters had been terrorising London for several days,
      burning houses in every direction, as well as Newgate and another prison,
      and looting street after street. They had already overthrown one brewery,
      and they found the incident so fascinating that they marched across the
      bridge to the Southwark concern, raising the cry that Thrale was a Papist.
      The Thrales were at this time sojourning at Bath, and were in an agony of
      suspense regarding their property. They had left Dr. Johnson comfortably
      ensconced at their Streatham house in order that they might learn in
      dignified language how things were going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Johnson's thrilling account of the incident:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to your house you all know. The harm is only a few
      butts of beer, and I think you may be sure that the danger is over. Pray
      tell Mr. Thrale that I live here, and have no fruit, and if he does not
      interpose am not likely to have much; but I think he might as well give me
      a little as give all to the gardener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a double catastrophe threatening, it would appear: the burning
      of the brewery and the shortage in the supply of Dr. Johnson's peaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how Mrs. Thrale describes the situation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but the astonishing presence of mind shewed by Perkins in amusing
      the mob, with meat and drink and huzzas, till Sir Philip Jennings Clerke
      could get the troops, and pack up the counting-house, bills, bonds etc.
      and carry them, which he did, to Chelsea College for safety, could have
      saved us from actual undoing. The villains <i>had</i> broke in, and our
      brew-house would have blazed in ten minutes, when a property of £150,000
      would have been utterly lost, and its once flourishing possessors quite
      undone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems almost incredible that Johnson, living at Streatham as the
      guardian of Mr. Thrale's interests, should require the lady to write to
      him, begging him to thank Perkins for his heroism. But so it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perkins has behaved like an Emperor,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;and it is my earnest
      wish and desire&mdash;command, if you please to call it so&mdash;that you
      will go over to the brew-house and express <i>your</i> sense of his good
      behaviour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thrale was unreasonable. How could Johnson be expected to take any
      action when he was deprived of his peaches?
    </p>
    <p>
      It will strike a good many modern readers of the account of this and other
      transactions that if it was Perkins who saved the brewery for Mr. Thrale,
      it was Mrs. Thrale who saved Perkins for the brewery. Possibly it was her
      prompt gift of the silver plate to Mrs. Perkins that induced this splendid
      manager to pocket the insult of the beggarly two hundred guineas given to
      him by Mrs. Thrale&mdash;though this was double the amount authorised by
      the &ldquo;master.&rdquo; Thrale never sufficiently valued the services of Perkins. If
      he had had any gratitude in his composition he would never have made
      Johnson one of his executors. What a trial it must have been to the
      competent man of business to see Johnson lumbering about the place with a
      pen behind his ear and an ink-pot suspended from a button of his coat,
      getting in the way of everybody, and yet feeling himself quite equal to
      any business emergency that might crop up. He felt himself equal to
      anything&mdash;even to improve upon the auctioneer's style in appraising
      the value of the whole concern. &ldquo;Beyond the dreams of avarice&rdquo; remains as
      the sole classic phrase born beneath the shadow of a brew-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of the premium to Perkins, Thrale should have felt that he
      had a treasure in his wife, to say nothing of all that she had done for
      him upon another occasion, involving a terrible sacrifice. A quarrel had
      broken out among the clerks at the brewery, which even the generalship of
      Perkins was unable to mollify. Had Mrs. Thrale been an ordinary woman she
      would not have jeopardised her own life and the life of her child&mdash;her
      thirteenth&mdash;in her husband's interests. As it was, however, she felt
      that the duty was imposed on her to settle the difficulties in the
      counting-house, and she did so; but only after many sleepless nights and
      the sacrifice of her child. &ldquo;The men were reconciled,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;and my
      danger accelerated their reconcilement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Henry Thrale was deficient in the best characteristics of a business
      man, his qualifications to shine socially can scarcely be regarded as
      abundant. There were stories of his having been a gay dog in his youth,
      but assuredly he and gaiety had long been strangers when he married his
      wife, and upon no occasion afterwards could he be so described even by the
      most indulgent of his friends; so that one rather inclines to the belief
      that the dull dog must have been a dull puppy. We know what his eldest
      daughter was, and we are convinced that the nature of that priggish,
      dignified, and eminently disagreeable young lady was inherited from her
      father. In Miss Thrale as a girl one feels that one is looking at Henry
      Thrale as a boy. The only story that survives of those mythical gay days
      with which he was accredited is that relating to the arrival of the
      Gunnings to take London by storm. It was said that he and Murphy thought
      to make these exquisite creatures the laughing-stock of the town by
      introducing them to a vulgar hanger-on of Murphy, in the character of a
      wealthy man of title and distinction. Possibly the two young men were put
      up to play this disgraceful prank upon the Gunnings by some jealous female
      associate; but however this may be, it not only failed most ignominiously,
      it recoiled upon the jesters themselves, for Mrs. Gunning, herself the
      sister of a nobleman, and destined to become the mother-in-law of two
      dukes and the grandmother of two more&mdash;the parent of a peeress in her
      own right, and an uncommonly shrewd Irishwoman into the bargain&mdash;&ldquo;smoaked,&rdquo;
       as the slang of the period had it, the trick, and her footman bundled the
      trio into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story may be true; but as both the Gunning girls were married in 1752,
      and Thrale did not meet Hester Lynch Salusbury till 1763, it was an old
      story then, and it was not remembered against him except by the Duchess of
      Hamilton. If it represents the standard of his adolescent wildness, we
      cannot but think that his youth was less meteoric than his wife believed
      it to be. At any rate, we do not know much about his early life, but we do
      know a great deal about his latter years, and it is impossible to believe
      that his nature underwent a radical change within a year or two of his
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became the host of a large number of the most notable people of that
      brilliant period at which he lived, and we perceive from the copious
      accounts that survive of the Streatham gatherings that he was greatly
      respected by all his visitors. He never said anything that was worth
      recording, and he never did anything memorable beyond stopping Johnson
      when the latter was becoming more than usually offensive to his
      fellow-guests. He had no ear for music any more than Johnson had, and it
      does not appear that he cared any more for painting, although he became a
      splendid patron of Sir Joshua Reynolds, whom he commissioned to paint
      several portraits of his distinguished friends for the decoration of the
      library at Streatham. To his munificence in this respect the world owes
      its finest portraits of Goldsmith, Burke, Garrick, the painter himself,
      and Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The debt which we feel we owe to Thrale on this account is, however,
      somewhat discounted when we learn that this enthusiastic patron of art
      never paid the painter for his work. He left the pictures and the
      obligation to pay for them as a legacy to his widow&mdash;and to pay for
      them at more than the current rate for each into the bargain. Sir Joshua
      Reynolds was as good a man of business as Thrale was an indifferent one.
      At the time of his painting the portraits his price for a
      three-quarter-length picture was £35, but in the course of a year or two
      he felt it necessary to charge £50 for the same size, and this was the
      price which the unfortunate widow had to pay for her husband's pose as the
      munificent patron of the Arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of the stamp of Thrale usually have no vices.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are highly respected. If they had a vice or two they would be
      beloved. He had a solitary failing, but it did not win for him the
      affection of any one: it was gluttony. For years of his life he gave
      himself up to the coarsest form of indulgence. He was not a gourmet: he
      did not aim at the refinements of the table or at those daintinesses of
      cuisine which in the days of intemperate eaters and drinkers proved so
      fatally fascinating to men of many virtues; no, his was the vice of the
      trough. He ate for the sake of eating, unmindful of the nature of the dish
      so long as it was plentiful enough to keep him employed for an hour or
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner-table of the famous Streatham Park must have been a spectacle
      for some of the philosophers who sat round it. We know what was the food
      that Johnson's soul loved, and we know how he was accustomed to partake of
      it. He rioted in pork, and in veal baked with raisins, and when he sat
      down to some such dainty he fed like a wild animal. He used his fingers as
      though they were claws, tearing the flesh from the bone in his teeth, and
      swallowing it not wholly without sound. It is not surprising to learn that
      his exertions caused the veins in his forehead to swell and the beads of
      perspiration to drop from his scholarly brow, nor can any one who has
      survived this account of his muscular feat at the dinner-table reasonably
      be amazed to hear that when so engaged, he devoted himself to the work
      before him to the exclusion of every other interest in life. He was
      oblivious of anything that was going on around him. He was deaf to any
      remark made by a neighbour, and for himself articulation was suspended.
      Doubtless the feeble folk on whom he had been trampling in the
      drawing-room felt that his peculiarities of feeding, though revolting to
      the squeamish, were not without a bright side. They had a chance of making
      a remark at such intervals without being gored&mdash;&ldquo;gored,&rdquo; it will be
      remembered, was the word employed by Boswell in playful allusion to the
      effect of his argumentative powers.

      Thanks to the careful habits of some of the guests at this famous house we
      know what fare was placed before the Gargantuan geniuses at one of these
      dinners. Here is the <i>carte du jour</i>, &ldquo;sufficient for twelve,&rdquo; as the
      cookery book says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First course, soups at head and foot, removed by fish and a saddle of
      mutton; second course, a fowl they call galena at head and a capon larger
      than some of our Irish turkeys at foot; third course, four different sorts
      of ices, pine-apple, grape, raspberry and a fourth; in each remove there
      were fourteen dishes.&rdquo; The world is indebted to an Irish clergyman for
      these details. It will be seen that they did not include much that could
      be sneered at as bordering on the kickshaw. All was good solid English
      fare&mdash;just the sort to make the veins in a gormandiser's forehead to
      swell and to induce the lethargy from which Thrale suffered. He usually
      fell asleep after dinner; one day he failed to awake, and he has not
      awakened since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Johnson, being invariably in delicate health, was compelled to
      put himself on an invalid's diet when at home. He gives us a sample of a
      <i>diner maigre</i> at Bolt Court. Feeling extremely ill, he wrote to Mrs.
      Thrale that he could only take for dinner &ldquo;skate, pudding, goose, and
      green asparagus, and could have eaten more but was prudent.&rdquo; He adds,
      &ldquo;Pray for me, dear Madam,&rdquo;&mdash;by no means an unnecessary injunction,
      some people will think, when they become aware of the details of the meal
      of an invalid within a year or two of seventy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after one of the Streatham dinners that Mrs. Thrale ventured to say
      a word or two in favour of Garrick's talent for light gay poetry, and as a
      specimen repeated his song in <i>Florizel and Perdita</i>, and dwelt with
      peculiar pleasure on this line:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I'd smile with the simple and dine with the poor.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Boswell's account of the matter, and he adds that Johnson cried,
      &ldquo;Nay, my dear lady, this will never do. Poor David! Smile with the simple!
      What folly is that? And who would feed with the poor that can help it? No,
      no; let me smile with the wise and feed with the rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite so; beyond a doubt Johnson spoke from the bottom of his heart&mdash;nay,
      from a deeper depth still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell was amazed to find that Garrick's &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo; as a writer was
      irritated when he related the story to him, and in Mrs. Thrale's copy of
      Johnson she made a note&mdash;&ldquo;How odd to go and tell the man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not at all odd that Boswell, being a professional tale-bearer and
      mischief-maker, should tell the man; but it is odd that Garrick should be
      irritated, the fact being that the sally was directed against a line which
      he did not write. What Garrick did write was something very different. The
      verse, which was misquoted, runs thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That giant Ambition we never can dread;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Our roofs are too low for so lofty a head;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Content and sweet Cheerfulness open our door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They smile with the simple and feed with the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a muddle as was made of the whole thing can only be attributed to the
      solidity of the Streatham fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was inevitable that Thrale could not continue over-eating himself with
      impunity. He was warned more than once by his doctors that he was killing
      himself, and yet when he had his first attack every one was shocked. He
      recovered temporarily, and all his friends implored him to cultivate
      moderation at the dinner-table. A touch of humour is to be found among the
      details of the sordid story, in his wife's begging Johnson&mdash;Johnson
      of the swollen forehead and the tokens of his submission to the primeval
      curse in the eating of his bread&mdash;to try to reason the unhappy man
      out of his dreadful vice. After wiping from the front of his coat the
      remains of the eighth peach which he had eaten before breakfast, or the
      dregs of his nineteenth cup of tea from his waistcoat, Johnson may have
      felt equal to the duty. He certainly remonstrated with Thrale. It was all
      to no purpose, however; he had a second attack of apoplexy in the spring
      of 1780, and we hear that he was copiously &ldquo;blooded.&rdquo; He recovered and
      went to Bath to recruit. It was during this visit to Bath that the brewery
      was attacked by the Gordon rioters. On returning to London he failed to
      induce his constituents to remain faithful to him, and he continued eating
      voraciously for another year. He began a week of gorging on April 1st,
      1781. His wife implored him to be more moderate, and Johnson said very
      wisely, &ldquo;Sir, after the denunciation of your physicians this morning, such
      eating is little better than suicide.&rdquo; It was all to no purpose. He
      survived the gorge of Sunday and Monday, but that of Tuesday was too much
      for him. He was found by his daughter on the floor in a fit of apoplexy,
      and died the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the man whose memory was outraged by the marriage of his widow
      with Piozzi, an Italian musician, whose ability was so highly appreciated
      that his earnings, even when he had lost his voice, amounted to £1200 a
      year, a sum equal to close upon £2500 of our money. And yet Johnson had
      the effrontery to suggest in that letter of his to Mrs. Thrale, which we
      have quoted, that she would do well to live in England, so that her money
      might be under her own eye!
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that Mrs. Thrale was in embarrassed circumstances when she
      married Signor Piozzi. Her worthy husband left her an annuity of £2000,
      which was to be reduced by £800 in the event of her marrying again; and
      also £500 for her immediate expenses. Johnson wrote to her, making her
      acquainted with this fact, in order, it would seem, to allay any unworthy
      suspicion which she might entertain as to the extent of her husband's
      generosity. But his last will and testament cannot have wholly dispersed
      the doubt into which her experience of Mr. Thrale may have led her. For a
      man who had been making from £16,000 to £20,000 a year to leave his wife
      only £2000 a year, with a possibility of its being reduced to £1200, would
      not strike any one as being generous to a point of recklessness. When,
      however, it is remembered that Thrale's wife plucked him and his business
      from the verge of bankruptcy more than once, that she bore him fourteen
      children, and that she lived with him for eighteen years, all question as
      to the generosity of his bequest to her vanishes. But when, in addition,
      it is remembered that the lady's fortune at her marriage to Thrale
      amounted to £10,000, all of which he pocketed, and that later on she
      brought him another £500 a year, that it was her mother's money, added to
      the sum which she herself collected personally, which saved the brewery
      from collapse&mdash;once again at the sacrifice of her infant&mdash;all
      question even of common fairness disappears, and the meanness of the man
      stands revealed.

      It was through the exertions and by the business capacity of his widow
      that the brewery was sold for £135,000. She was the only one of the
      trustees who knew anything definite about the value of the property, and
      had she not been on the spot, that astute Mr. Perkins could have so worked
      the concern that he might have been able to buy it in a year or two for
      the value of the building materials. And yet when she became involved in a
      lawsuit that involved the paying of £7000, she had difficulty in
      persuading her daughters' trustees to advance her the money, although the
      security of the mortgage which she offered for the accommodation would
      have satisfied any bankers. A wretch named Crutchley, who was one of this
      precious band of incompetents, on the completion of the deed bade her
      thank her daughters for keeping her out of gaol. It is not recorded that
      the lady replied, though she certainly might have done so, and with truth
      on her side, that if her daughters had kept her out of a gaol she had kept
      her daughters out of a workhouse. She would have done much better to have
      gone to her friends the Barclays, whose bank had a hundred and fifty years
      ago as high a reputation for probity combined with liberality as the same
      concern enjoys to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough of the business side of Mrs. Thrale's second marriage has been
      revealed to make it plain that Piozzi was not influenced by any mercenary
      motives in the transaction. On the contrary, it was he who came to her
      assistance when she was in an extremity, and by the prompt loan of £1000
      extricated her from her embarrassment, and left the next day for Italy,
      without having any hope of marrying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson's verdict on Piozzi, communicated to Miss Seward, was that he was
      an ugly dog, without particular skill in his profession. Unfortunately for
      this musical enthusiast and devotee to beauty, Miss Seward met Piozzi on
      his return from Italy with his wife. (His excellent control of her money
      had resulted in every penny of the mortgage being paid, and of the
      lodgment of £1500 to their credit in the bank). And Miss Seward, writing
      from Lichfield&mdash;more of the irony of Fate&mdash;in 1787, affirmed
      that the great Lichfield man &ldquo;did not tell me the truth when he asserted
      that Piozzi was an ugly dog, without particular skill in his profession.
      M. Piozzi is a handsome man in middle life, with gentle, pleasing,
      unaffected manners, and with very eminent skill in his profession. Though
      he has not a powerful or fine-toned voice, he sings with transcending
      grace and expression. I was charmed with his perfect expression on his
      instrument. Surely the finest sensibilities must vibrate through his
      frame, since they breathe so sweetly through his song.&rdquo; From this verdict
      no person who was acquainted with Signor Piozzi differed. Mrs. Thrale's
      marriage with Piozzi was as fortunate for her as her first marriage was
      for Thrale.

    <h2>
      A TRAGEDY IN THE HAYMARKET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>BOUT half-past
      nine o'clock on the night of October 6th, 1769, a tall, middle-aged
      gentleman named Joseph Baretti was walking up the Hay-market. The street
      was probably as well lighted as any other in London, and this is
      equivalent to saying that a foot passenger, by keeping close to the
      windows of the shops and taking cross bearings of the economically
      distributed oil lamps hung out at the corners of the many lanes, might be
      able to avoid the deep channel of filth that slunk along the margin of
      cobble stones. But just at this time the Haymarket must have been
      especially well illuminated, for the Opera House was in the act of
      discharging its audience, and quite a number of these fashionable folk
      went home in their chairs, with link boys walking by the side of the burly
      Irish chairmen, showing a flaring flame which left behind it a long trail
      of suffocating smoke, and spluttered resin and bitumen into the faces and
      upon the garments of all who were walking within range of the illuminant.
      Then there was the little theatre higher up the street, and its lamps were
      not yet extinguished; so that Mr. Baretti may have felt that on the whole
      he was fortunate in the hour he had chosen for his stroll to the
      coffee-house where he meant to sup. He may have thought that he had a
      chance of coming across his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds leaving one of the
      playhouses, and of being invited by that hospitable gentleman to his house
      in Leicester Fields; or his still more intimate friend Dr. Samuel Johnson,
      who would certainly insist on carrying him off to the &ldquo;Mitre,&rdquo; unless the
      great man were accompanied by that little Scotch person, James Boswell,
      who usually wanted him all to himself, after he had given people a chance
      of seeing him in the company of his distinguished friend, and envying him
      his position of intimacy&mdash;the same position of intimacy that exists
      between a Duke and his doormat. Mr. Baretti was too short-sighted to have
      any chance of recognising Sir Joshua Reynolds unless he chanced to be
      standing under the lamp in the portico of the playhouse, but he felt that
      he would have no trouble in recognising Dr. Johnson. The latter had
      characteristics that appealed to other senses than the sense of seeing,
      and made the act of recognition easy enough to his intimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baretti, however, passed along the dispersing crowd, and was soon in
      the dim regions of Panton Street, where pedestrians were few. But before
      he had turned down this street he found his way barred by a couple of
      half-drunken women. His infirmity of sight prevented his being aware of
      their presence until he was almost in the arms of one of them, and the
      very second that he made his sudden stop she made a change in the details
      of the accident that seemed imminent and threw herself into his arms with
      a yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man was staggered for a moment, but, recovering himself, he flung
      her off with an expressive word or two in the Italian tongue. She went
      limply back and, being adroitly avoided by her companion, gave a circular
      stagger or two and fell into the gutter with a screech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baretti was hurrying on when out of the darkness of Panton Street a big
      man sprang, followed quickly by two others. The first seized him by the
      right arm with the oath of a bully, the others tried to trip him up,
      shouting that he had killed a lady. Baretti was a powerful man and
      decidedly tough. He struck at the fellow who had closed with him, and used
      his feet against the attack of the others with considerable effect. He
      managed to free his arm, but before he could draw his sword he was pulled
      backward and would have fallen upon his head if he had not clutched the
      coat of the man from whom he had freed himself. There was a pause of a few
      seconds, filled up by the wild street yell of the women. The most
      aggressive of the three men leapt upon the unfortunate Baretti, but before
      their bodies met, gave a guttural shriek, then a groan. He staggered past,
      his fingers tearing like talons at his ribs; he whirled twice round and,
      gasping, fell on his knees, motionless only for a few seconds; his hands
      dropped limply from his side, and he pitched forward on his head into the
      gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baretti was standing, awaiting a further attack, with a knife in his hand,
      when he was seized by some of the crowd. He offered no resistance. He
      seemed to be so amazed at finding himself alive as to be incapable of
      taking any further action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has killed the man&mdash;stabbed him with a dagger to the very heart!&rdquo;
       was the cry that came from those of the crowd who were kneeling beside the
      wretch in the gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a woman&mdash;he had slain a woman at the outset. Hold him fast. None
      of us are safe this night. Have a care for the dagger, friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sufficiency of advice was given by the excited onlookers to the men who
      had encircled Baretti&mdash;one of them was clinging to him with his arms
      clasped around his body&mdash;until two of the Haymarket watch hurried up,
      striking right and left with their staves after the wholesome manner of
      the period, and so making a way for their approach through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis more than a street brawl&mdash;a man has been slain&mdash;some say a
      woman also,&rdquo; a shopkeeper explained to them, having run bareheaded out of
      his shop; his apprentice had just put up the last of the shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had Baretti by the collar in a second, cautiously disarming him,
      holding the weapon up to the nearest lamp. The blade was still wet with
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A swinging matter this,&rdquo; one of them remarked. &ldquo;I can swear to the blood.
      No dagger, but a knife. What man walks the streets at night with a naked
      knife unless slaughter is his intent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, I was attacked by three bullies, and I defended myself&mdash;that
      is all,&rdquo; said Baretti. He spoke English perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will need to tell that to Sir John in the morning,&rdquo; said one of the
      watchmen. &ldquo;You are apprehended in the King's name. Where is the poor
      victim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some of the crowd who saw how I was attacked,&rdquo; said
      Baretti. &ldquo;They will testify that I acted in self-defence. Sirs, hear me
      make an appeal to you. Out of your sense of justice&mdash;you will not see
      an innocent man apprehended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knife&mdash;who carries a bare knife in the streets unless with
      intent?&rdquo; said a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas my fruit-knife. I never go abroad without it. I eat my fruit like a
      Christian, not like a pig or an Englishman,&rdquo; was the defence offered by
      Baretti, who had now quite lost his temper and was speaking with his
      accustomed bitterness. He usually sought to pass as an Englishman, but he
      was now being arrested by the minions of the law as it was in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear him! A pig of an Englishman. Those were his words! A foreign hound.
      Frenchie, I'll be bound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A spy&mdash;most like a Papist. He has the hanging brow of a born
      Papist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll hang like a dog at Tyburn&mdash;he may be sure o' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis the mercy o' Heaven that the rascal was caught red-handed! Sirs,
      this may be the beginning of a dreadful massacring plot against the lives
      of honest and peaceful people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The comments of a crowd of the period upon such an incident as the
      stabbing of an Englishman by a foreigner in the streets of London can
      easily be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when Baretti was put into a hackney coach and driven off to Bow
      Street the crowd doubtless remained talking in groups of the menace to
      English freedom and true religion by the arrival of pestilent foreigners,
      every man of them carrying a knife. It would be a sad day for England when
      Jesuitical fruit-knives took the place of good wholesome British bludgeons
      in the settlement of the ordinary differences incidental to a Protestant
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that this was one of the comments of the disintegrating
      crowd, and it is equally certain that Baretti commented pretty freely to
      his custodians in the hackney coach upon the place occupied in the comity
      of nations of that State, the social conditions of whose metropolis made
      possible so gross a scandal as the arrest of a gentleman and a scholar,
      solely by reason of his success in snatching his life out of the talons of
      a ruffian and a bully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baretti was a gentleman and a scholar whose name appears pretty
      frequently in the annals of the eighteenth century, but seldom with any
      great credit to himself. As a matter of fact, this dramatic episode of the
      stabbing of the man in the Haymarket is the happiest with which his name
      is associated. He made his most creditable appearance in the chronicles of
      the period as the chief actor in this sordid drama. He cuts a very poor
      figure indeed upon every other occasion when he appears in the pages of
      his contemporaries, though they all meant to be kind to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never could bear people to be kind to him, and certainly, so far as he
      himself was concerned, it cannot be said that any blame attaches to him
      for the persistence of his friends in this direction. He did all that
      mortal man could do to discourage them, and if after the lapse of a year
      or two he was still treated by some with cordiality or respect, assuredly
      it was not owing to his display of any qualities that justified their
      maintenance of such an attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baretti was an eminently detestable scholar of many parts. He was as
      detestable as he was learned&mdash;perhaps even more so. Learned men are
      not invariably horrid, unless they are men of genius as well, and this
      rarely happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baretti had no such excuse, though it must be acknowledged that his
      capacity for being disagreeable almost amounted to genius. Such a
      character as his is now and again met with in daily life. A man who feels
      himself to be, in point of scholarly attainment, far above the majority of
      men, and who sees inferiority occupying a place of distinction while he
      remains neglected and, to his thinking, unappreciated, is not an uncommon
      figure in learned or artistic circles. Baretti was a disappointed man, and
      he showed himself to be such. He had a grievance against the world for
      being constituted as it is. He had a grievance against society. He had a
      grievance against his friends who got on in the world. But the only people
      against whom he was really malevolent were those who were signally and
      unaccountably kind to him. He accepted their kindness, and then turned and
      rent them.

    <p>
      Dr. Johnson met him when they were both working for the booksellers, and
      when the great dictionary scheme was floated his co-operation was
      welcomed. Johnson's success in life was largely due to his faculty for
      discovering people who could be useful to him. It can easily be believed
      that, knowing something of the scholarship of Baretti, he should be
      delighted to avail himself of his help. Baretti had an intimate knowledge
      of several languages and their literature; as a philologist he was
      probably far superior to Johnson; and possibly Johnson knew this, though
      he was doubtless too wise ever to acknowledge so much openly. We do not
      hear that the relations between the two ever became strained while the
      great work was in course of progress. Shortly after it was completed
      Baretti returned to his native Italy, and began to reproach Johnson for
      not writing to him more frequently. We have several examples of the
      cheerfulness with which Johnson set about exculpating himself from such
      reproaches. The letters which he wrote to him at Italy are among the most
      natural that ever came from his pen. They are models of the gossipy style
      which Johnson could assume without once deviating from that dignity which
      so frequently became ponderous, suggesting the dignity of the elephant
      rather than that of the lion. Walpole was a master of the art of being
      gossipy without being dignified. But Johnson's style was not flexible. We
      have not Baretti's letters to Johnson, but the references made by the
      latter to some matters communicated to him by his correspondent let us
      know something of how Baretti was getting on in the land of his birth. He
      seems to have set his heart upon obtaining some appointment in Italy, and
      his aspirations included marriage. He was disappointed in both directions;
      and it would be too much to expect that his temper was improved by these
      rebuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may well be believed that he quarrelled his way through Italy. &ldquo;I have
      lately seen Mr. Stratico, Professor of Padua, who has told me of your
      quarrel with an abbot of the Celestine Order, but had not the particulars
      very ready in his memory,&rdquo; Johnson wrote to him at Milan. Any one who
      could quarrel with an abbot of the Celestine Order would, we fancy, be <i>capable
      de tout</i>, like the prophet Habakkuk, according to the witty Frenchman.
      One is not disposed to be hard upon Professor Stratico for his shortness
      of memory in regard to this particular quarrel; the strain of remembering
      the details of all the quarrels of Mr. Baretti would be too great for any
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Dr. Johnson gave him some excellent advice. It seems that poor
      Baretti had been at first so well received on his return to Italy that he
      became sanguine of success in all his enterprises, and when they
      miscarried he wrote very bitterly to Johnson, who replied as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for your disappointment, with which you seem more touched than
      I should expect a man of your resolution and experience to have been, did
      I not know that general truths are seldom applied to particular occasions;
      and that the fallacy of our selflove extends itself as wide as our
      interests or affections. Every man believes that mistresses are unfaithful
      and patrons capricious; but he excepts his own mistress and his own
      patron. We have all learned that greatness is negligent and contemptuous,
      and that in Courts life is often languished away in ungratified
      expectation; but he that approaches greatness or glitters in a Court,
      imagines that destiny has at last exempted him from the common lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful if this excellent philosophy made the person to whom it was
      addressed more amiable to his immediate entourage; nor is it likely that
      he was soothed by the assurance that his &ldquo;patron's weakness or
      insensibility will finally do you little hurt, if he is not assisted by
      your own passions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your love,&rdquo; continued Johnson, &ldquo;I know not the propriety; we can
      estimate the power, but in love, as in every other passion of which hope
      is the essence, we ought always to remember the uncertainty of events.&rdquo; He
      then hastens to add that &ldquo;love and marriage are different states. Those
      who are to suffer the evils together, and to suffer often for the sake of
      one another, soon lose that tenderness of look, and that benevolence of
      mind which arose from the participation of unmingled pleasure and success
      in amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pleasant little cynical bark in the phrase &ldquo;those that are to suffer
      the evils together,&rdquo; as if it referred to love and marriage, is, Malone
      thinks, not Johnson's, but Baretti's. It is suggested that Johnson really
      wrote &ldquo;those that are to suffer the evils <i>of life</i> together,&rdquo; and
      that Baretti in transcribing the letter for Boswell, purposely omitted the
      words &ldquo;<i>of life</i>.&rdquo; It would be quite like Baretti to do this; for he
      would thereby work off part of his spite against Johnson for having given
      him the advice, and he would have had his own sneer against &ldquo;love and
      marriage,&rdquo; the <i>fons et origo</i> of his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of Dr. Johnson's esteem for the attainments of Baretti there can be no
      doubt. He thought that the book on Italy which he published on his return
      to England was very entertaining, adding: &ldquo;Sir, I know no man who carries
      his head higher in conversation than Baretti. There are strong powers in
      his mind. He has not, indeed, many hooks; but with what hooks he has he
      grapples very forcibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

      <a href="images/0099.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      It may seem rather strange after this that Baretti was never admitted to
      the membership of the celebrated club. He was intimate with nearly all the
      original members, but the truth remained that he was not what Johnson
      called a clubbable man: he had too many hooks, not too few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the man who was brought before Sir John Fielding, the magistrate
      at Bow Street, on the morning after the tragedy, charged with murder; and
      then it was that he found the value of the friendships which he had formed
      in England. The first person to hasten to his side in his extremity was
      Oliver Goldsmith, the man whom he had so frequently made the object of his
      sarcasm, whose peculiarities he had mimicked, not in the playful manner of
      Garrick or Foote, but in his own spiteful style, with the grim humour of
      the disappointed man. Goldsmith it was who opened his purse for him and
      got a coach for him when he was remanded until the next day, riding by his
      side to the place of his incarceration. Goldsmith was by his side when the
      question of bail was discussed before Lord Mansfield. For some reason
      which does not require any particular explanation, it was not thought that
      Goldsmith as a bailsman would appeal irresistibly to the authorities, but
      the names of Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Edmund Burke, Mr. David Garrick, and
      Mr. H. Fitzherbert were submitted to Lord Mansfield, and immediately
      accepted. An amusing anecdote was current regarding the few days of
      Baretti's incarceration. One morning he was visited by a teacher of
      languages, who begged a trifling favour of him. This was merely a letter
      of recommendation to Baretti's pupils, so that the applicant might have a
      chance of taking them over &ldquo;when you are hanged, sir.&rdquo; The fact that this
      sympathetic visitor was allowed to depart without molestation makes people
      doubt whether Baretti was so bad-tempered after all. He did not assault
      the man. &ldquo;You rascal!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If I were not in my own room, I would
      kick you downstairs directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trial was fixed for October 20th at the Old Bailey, and a few days
      before this date a number of the prisoner's friends met together to
      consult as to the line which should be taken for his defence. It seems
      that they were not all agreed on some points; this was only to be
      expected, considering what an array of wisdom was brought together upon
      the occasion of these consultations, and considering also the course which
      was adopted by Dr. Johnson, who thought that the interests of the prisoner
      would be advanced by getting up an academical discussion with Burke.
      Johnson and Burke were notorious rivals in conversation in those days when
      conversation was regarded as an art, and men and women seemed to have
      plenty of leisure to talk together for the sake of talking, and to argue
      together for the sake of argument, and to be rude to one another for the
      sake of wit. Boswell was for ever extolling Johnson at the expense of
      Burke; and indeed, so far as one can gather from his pages, Johnson was
      the ruder man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example that Boswell gives of his own readiness in making Goldsmith
      &ldquo;shut up&rdquo; when he questioned Johnson's superiority to Burke in discussion
      is one of the best instances of the little Scotsman's incapacity to
      perceive the drift of an argument. &ldquo;Is he like Burke who winds into a
      subject like a serpent?&rdquo; asked Goldsmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&rdquo; (said I) &ldquo;Dr. Johnson is the Hercules that strangled serpents in his
      cradle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This repartee which Boswell gleefully records is about equal to the reply
      made by one of the poets who was appealed to in the &ldquo;Bab Ballads&rdquo; to say
      if he wrote &ldquo;the lovely cracker mottoes my Elvira pulls at supper.&rdquo; It
      will be remembered that the poet whose name rhymes with &ldquo;supper&rdquo; replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      &ldquo;'A fool is bent upon a twig, but wise men dread a bandit,'
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Which&rdquo; (the earnest inquirer said) &ldquo;I felt was very wise,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      but I didn't understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in regard to this consultation as to the best defence to be made
      out for Baretti that Johnson admitted to have opposed Burke simply for the
      sake of showing the rest of the company that he could get the better of
      Burke in an argument. &ldquo;Burke and I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;should have been of one
      opinion if we had had no audience.&rdquo; Such a confession! There was the life
      of his friend Baretti trembling in the balance, and yet Johnson, solely
      for the sake of &ldquo;showing off,&rdquo; opposed the wisdom and ingenuity Burke
      exercised to save from the gallows a man whom Johnson professed to admire!
    </p>
    <p>
      But if we are to believe Boswell, Johnson cared very little whether his
      friend was hanged or not. As for Boswell himself, he always detested
      Baretti, and is reported to have expressed the earnest hope that the man
      would be hanged. However, the &ldquo;consultations&rdquo; went merrily on, and
      doubtless contributed in some measure to a satisfactory solution of the
      vexed question as to whether Johnson or Burke was the more brilliant
      talker. They formed a tolerably valid excuse for the uncorking of several
      bottles, and perhaps these friends of Baretti felt that even though he
      should die, yet the exchange of wit in the course of these happy evenings
      would live for ever in the memory of those present, so that after all, let
      the worst come to the worst, Baretti should have little cause for
      complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is reported that the prisoner, upon the occasion of his receiving a
      visit from Johnson and Burke, cried: &ldquo;What need a man fear who holds two
      such hands?&rdquo; It may here be mentioned, however, that although it was
      asserted that Johnson and Murphy were responsible for the line of defence
      adopted at the trial, yet in after years Baretti was most indignant that
      it should be suggested that credit should be given to any one but himself
      for his defence; and he ridiculed the notion that Johnson or Burke or
      Murphy or even Boswell&mdash;himself an aspirant to the profession of law
      in which he subsequently displayed a conspicuous lack of distinction&mdash;had
      anything to do with the instruction either of solicitors or barristers on
      his behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, the &ldquo;consultations&rdquo; came to an end, and the friends of the
      accused awaited the trial with exemplary patience. Mr. Boswell seems
      suddenly to have become the most sympathetic of the friends; for three
      days before the event he took a journey to Tyburn to witness the hanging
      of several men at that place, and though it is known that the spectacle of
      a hanging never lost its charm for him, yet it is generous to assume that
      upon this occasion he went to Tyburn in order to qualify himself more
      fully for sympathising with Baretti, should the defence assigned to him
      break down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another ardent sympathiser was Mr. Thomas Davies the bookseller, a
      gentleman whose chief distinction in the eyes of his contemporaries
      consisted&mdash;if we are to believe one of the wittiest of his associates&mdash;in
      the fact that he had an exceedingly pretty wife; but whose claim to the
      gratitude of coming generations lies in the circumstance of his having
      introduced Boswell to Johnson. Tom Davies was terribly cut up at the
      thought of the possibility of Baretti's being sentenced to be hanged.
      Boswell, on the day before the trial, after telling Johnson how he had
      witnessed the executions at Tyburn, and expressing his surprise that none
      of the wretches seemed to think anything of the matter, mentioned that
      Foote, the actor, had shown him a letter which he had received from Tom
      Davies, and in which the writer affirmed that he had not had a wink of
      sleep owing to his anxiety in respect of &ldquo;this sad affair of Baretti,&rdquo; and
      begging Foote to suggest some way by which he could be of service to the
      accused, adding that should Mr. Foote be in need of anything in the pickle
      line, he could strongly recommend him to an industrious young man who had
      lately set up in that business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, Johnson was not impressed with this marked evidence of Mr.
      Davies' kind heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sir, here you have a specimen of human sympathy,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A friend
      hanged and a cucumber pickled! We know not whether Baretti or the pickle
      man has kept Davies from sleep; nor does he know himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was rather sweeping, but his dictum showed that he was rather a poor
      analyser of human emotion. In the minds of the people of to-day who read
      of Tom Davies' bad nights there is no manner of doubt whatever that the
      sequence of his emotions was to be attributed to his intimacy with the
      industrious young pickle maker. Tom had indulged rather too freely in some
      of the specimens of his art presented to him by the pickler, and the
      result was a melancholy night; and, being melancholy, he was led to think
      of the most melancholy incident that had recently come under his notice.
      When a man is full of mixed pickles he is liable to get a little mixed,
      and so in the morning he attributed his miserable night to his thoughts
      about Baretti, instead of knowing that his thoughts about Baretti were the
      natural result of his miserable night. If he had been acquainted with an
      industrious young onion merchant he might have passed the night in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for his not sleeping,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;sir, Tom Davies is a very
      great man&mdash;Tom has been on the stage, and knows how to do those
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boswell: &ldquo;I have often blamed myself, sir, for not feeling for others as
      sensibly as many say they do.&rdquo; Johnson: &ldquo;Sir, don't be duped by them any
      more. You will find those very feeling people are not very ready to do you
      good. They pay you by feeling.&rdquo; Mr. Boswell thought that he would do well
      to turn his friend from the subject under discussion, so he made the
      apparently harmless remark that Foote had a great deal of humour and that
      he had a singular talent of exhibiting character. But Johnson had on him
      the mood not only of &ldquo;the rugged Russian bear,&rdquo; but also of &ldquo;the armed
      rhinoceros and the Hyrcan tiger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, it is not a talent: it is a vice; it is what others abstain from,&rdquo;
       he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not he think of exhibiting you, sir?&rdquo; inquired the tactful Mr.
      Boswell, though he knew all about Foote and Johnson long before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, fear restrained him,&rdquo; said Johnson. &ldquo;He knew I would have broken his
      bones. I would have saved him the trouble of cutting off a leg: I would
      not have left him a leg to cut off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brutal reference to the fact that Foote's recent accident had
      compelled him to have a leg amputated should surely have suggested to his
      inquisitor that he had probably been paying a visit to an industrious
      young pickle maker without Tom Davies' recommendation, or that he had
      partaken of too generous a helping of his favourite veal, baked with
      plums, and so that he would do well to leave him alone for a while. But
      no, Mr. Boswell was not to be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir, is not Foote an infidel?&rdquo; he inquired. But as he himself had
      been dining with Foote the previous day, and as he possessed no more
      delicacy than a polecat, he could easily have put the question to Foote
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Johnson would not even give the man credit for his infidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, sir, that the fellow is an infidel,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but if he
      is an infidel, he is an infidel as a dog is an infidel, that is to say, he
      has never thought on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another second he was talking of Buchanan, a poet, whom he praised, and
      of Shakespeare, another poet, whom he condemned, winding up by saying that
      there were some very fine things in Dr. Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>. But
      the most remarkable of his deliverances on this rather memorable evening
      had reference to Baretti's fate. After declaring that if one of his
      friends had just been hanged he would eat his dinner every bit as heartily
      as if his friend were still alive.&mdash;&ldquo;Why, there's Baretti, who is to
      be tried for his life to-morrow,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;friends have risen up for him
      on every side; yet if he should be hanged, none of them will eat a slice
      of plum pudding the less.&rdquo; Happily the accuracy of this tender-hearted
      scholar's prediction had no chance of being put to the test. Baretti was
      tried and acquitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell gives only a few lines to an account of the trial, and fails to
      mention that the prisoner declined the privilege of being tried by a jury
      one half of whom should be foreigners. &ldquo;It took place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at the
      awful Sessions House, emphatically called Justice Hall,&rdquo; and he affirms
      that &ldquo;never did such a constellation of genius enlighten the Old Bailey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He mentions that Mr. Burke, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Beauclerk, and Dr. Johnson
      gave evidence, the last-named being especially impressive, speaking in a
      slow, deliberate, and distinct tone of voice. It seems strange that
      Boswell, who was (nominally) a lawyer, when he wrote his life of Johnson,
      should say nothing whatever respecting the line of defence adopted by the
      friends of the prisoner upon this interesting occasion. It might have been
      expected that he would dwell lovingly, as a lawyer would certainly be
      pardoned for doing, upon the technical points involved in the trial, even
      though he hated Baretti. For instance, it would be interesting to learn
      why it was thought that the result of the trial might mean the hanging of
      Baretti, when from the first it was perfectly plain that he had acted in
      self-defence: not merely was he protecting his purse, he had actually to
      fight for his life against an acknowledged ruffian of the most
      contemptible type. In the present day if a short-sighted man of letters&mdash;say
      Mr. Augustine Birrell&mdash;were to be attacked in a dark street by three
      notorious scoundrels and to manage to kill one of them by poking the
      ferrule end of an umbrella into his eye, no one&mdash;not even a
      Conservative Attorney-General&mdash;would fancy that a grand jury at the
      New Old Bailey would return a true bill against him for the act, putting
      aside all question of his being found guilty and sentenced to be hanged.
      And yet in Baretti's time swords were commonly worn, and they were by no
      means toy weapons. Why should poor Tom Davies have a sleepless night,
      owing (as he believed) to his apprehension that his friend would be hanged
      in a day or two? Why was it necessary to dazzle the &ldquo;awful Sessions House&rdquo;
       by such &ldquo;a constellation of genius&rdquo; as had never before assembled in that
      &ldquo;Hall of Justice&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boswell might certainly have told us something of the actual scene in
      the court, when he has devoted so much space to the ridiculous dialogues
      between himself and Johnson, having more or less bearing upon the case.
      The course he adopted is like laying a dinner-table with four knives and
      forks and five wineglasses for every guest&mdash;in having a constellation
      of genii in plush behind every chair, and then serving a dinner of hashed
      mutton only. A great number of people believe that whatever Boswell may
      have been, he was invariably accurate. But in this case he does not even
      give a true account of the constellation of genius to which he refers. He
      only says that Burke, Garrick, Beauclerk, and Johnson were called as
      witnesses. He omits to say a word about Goldsmith, who was something of a
      genius; or Reynolds, who was quite a tolerable painter; or Fitzherbert,
      who had a wide reputation as a politician; or Dr. Halifax, whose evidence
      carried certainly as much weight as Johnson's. He does not even say a word
      respecting the evidence which Johnson and the others were called on to
      give on behalf of the prisoner at the bar. What is the good of telling us
      that the constellation of genius had never been paralleled within the
      precincts of the &ldquo;emphatically called Justice Hall&rdquo; if we are not made
      aware of some of the flashes of their genius when they were put into the
      witness-box?

    <p>
      The truth is that Boswell had no sense of proportion any more than a sense
      of the sublime and beautiful&mdash;or, for that matter, a sense of the
      ridiculous. He was the Needy Knife Grinder&mdash;with an occasional axe of
      his own&mdash;of the brilliant circle into which he crawled, holding on to
      Johnson's skirts and half concealing himself beneath their capacious
      flaps. He had constant stories suggested to him, but he failed to see
      their possibilities. He was a knife grinder and nothing more; but at his
      own trade he was admirable; he ground away patiently at his trivialities
      respecting the man whom he never was within leagues of understanding, and
      it is scarcely fair to reproach him for not throwing away his grindstone,
      which he knew how to use, and taking to that of a diamond cutter, which he
      was incapable of manipulating. But surely he might have told us something
      more of the actual trial of Baretti instead of giving us page after page
      leading up to the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      From other sources we learn that what all the geniuses were called on to
      testify to was the pacific character of Baretti, and this they were all
      able to do in an emphatic manner. It would seem that it was assumed that
      the prisoner, a short-sighted, middle-aged man of letters, was possessed
      of all the dangerous qualities of a bloodthirsty brigand of his own
      country&mdash;that he was a fierce and ungovernable desperado, who was in
      the habit of prowling about the purlieus of the Haymarket to do to death
      with a fruit-knife the peaceful citizens whom he might encounter. He was a
      foreigner, and he had killed an Englishman with an outlandish weapon. That
      seems to have been the reason there was for the apprehension, which was
      very general in respect of the fate of Baretti, for it was upon these
      points that his witnesses were most carefully examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith, Reynolds, and Garrick were very useful witnesses regarding the
      knife. They affirmed that in carrying a fruit-knife the prisoner was in no
      way departing from the recognised custom of his fellow-countrymen. He, in
      common with them, was in the habit of eating a great deal of fruit, so
      that the knife was a necessity with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson's evidence was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known Mr. Baretti a long time. He is a man of literature&mdash;a
      very studious man&mdash;a man of great intelligence. He gets his living by
      study. I have no reason to think he was ever disordered with liquor in his
      life. A man that I have never known to be otherwise than peaceable and a
      man that I take to be rather timorous. As to his eyesight, he does not see
      me now, nor do I see him. I do not believe he would be capable of
      assaulting anybody in the street without great provocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be denied that the reference to Baretti's imperfect sight told
      upon the jury, and uttered as the words were by Johnson in his dignified
      way, they could scarcely fail to produce a profound effect upon the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baretti was acquitted, and no one could presume to refer to him for the
      rest of his life except as a quiet, inoffensive, frugivorous gentleman,
      since these were the qualities with which he was endowed by a
      constellation of geniuses on their oath. He was acquitted by the jury; but
      the judge thought it well to say a few words to him before allowing him to
      leave the dock, and the drift of his discourse amounted to a severe
      censure upon his impetuosity, and the expression of a hope that the
      inconvenience to which he was put upon this occasion would act as a
      warning to him in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really one could hardly imagine that in those days, when every week Mr.
      Boswell had a chance of going to such an entertainment at Tyburn as he had
      attended forty-eight hours before the opening of the Sessions, the taking
      of the life of a human being was regarded with such horror. One cannot
      help recalling the remark made by Walpole a few years later, that, owing
      to the severity of the laws, England had been turned into one vast
      shambles; nor can one quite forget the particulars of the case which was
      quoted as having an intimate bearing upon this contention&mdash;the case
      in which a young wife whose husband had been impressed to serve in His
      Majesty's Fleet, and who had consequently been left without any means of
      support, had stolen a piece of bread to feed her starving children, and
      had been hanged at Tyburn for the crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading the judge's censure of Baretti, who had, in preventing a
      contemptible ruffian from killing him, decreased by a unit the criminality
      of London, the only conclusion that one can come to is that the courts of
      law were very jealous of their precious prerogative to kill. Looking at
      the matter in this light, the bombastic phrase of Boswell does not seem so
      ridiculous after all; the Old Bailey had certainly good reason to be
      regarded as the &ldquo;awful Sessions House.&rdquo; But we are not so fully convinced
      that it had any right to be referred to as emphatically the Hall of
      Justice. In the Georgian Pageant the common hangman played too conspicuous
      a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the unfortunate, if impetuous, Baretti left the court a free man, and
      we cannot doubt that in the company of his friends who had stood by him in
      his hour of trial he was a good deal harder upon the judge than the judge
      had been upon him; and probably he was reproved in a grave and dignified
      manner by Dr. Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds standing by with his ear
      trumpet, fearful lest a single word of Johnson's wisdom should escape him.
      Doubtless Mr. Garrick, the moment Johnson's back was turned, gave an
      inimitable imitation of both Johnson and Baretti&mdash;perhaps of the
      judge as well, and most likely the usher of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, when the avaricious Reynolds had hastened back to his studio in
      Leicester Fields to daub on canvas the figures of some of his sitters at
      the extortionate price of thirty-five guineas for a three-quarter length,
      he and Johnson put their heads together to devise what could be done for
      Baretti.
    </p>
    <p>
      For about a year Baretti resumed his old way of living, working for the
      booksellers and completing his volume of travel through Europe, by which
      it is said he made £500. It would appear, however, that all his pupils had
      transferred themselves to the enterprising gentleman who had appealed to
      him at an inopportune moment for his recommendation, or to some of his
      other brethren, for by the end of the year he was in needy circumstances.
      Meantime he had been made by Sir Joshua Reynolds Honorary Secretary for
      Foreign Correspondence to the Royal Academy, and then Johnson recommended
      him to the husband of Mrs. Thrale as tutor to her girls at Streatham. This
      was very kind to Baretti, but it was rather hard on the Thrales.
      Apparently from the first day he went to Streatham his attitude in regard
      to the Thrale family was one of spite and malevolence; and there can be no
      doubt that Johnson bitterly regretted his patronage of a man who seemed
      never to forgive any one who had done him a good turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agreement made by him with the Thrales was that he should practically
      be his own master, only residing at Streatham as a member of the family
      with no fixed salary. He was as artful as an Irish cabman in suggesting
      this &ldquo;leave it to your honour&rdquo; contract. He had heard on all hands of the
      liberality of Mr. Thrale, and he knew that, in addition to being provided
      with a luxurious home, he would receive presents from him far in excess of
      what he could earn. He was extremely well treated for the next three
      years, though he was for ever grumbling when he had a moment's leisure
      from insulting the Thrales and their guests. Mrs. Thrale said more in his
      favour than any one with whom he came in contact. She wrote: &ldquo;His lofty
      consciousness of his own superiority which made him tenacious of every
      position, and drew him into a thousand distresses, did not, I must own,
      ever disgust me, till he began to exercise it against myself, and resolve
      to reign in our house by fairly defying the mistress of it. Pride,
      however, though shocking enough, is never despicable; but vanity, which he
      possessed too, in an eminent degree, will sometimes make a man near sixty
      ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly Mrs. Thrale &ldquo;let him down&rdquo; very gently. Dr. Thomas Campbell, a
      clergyman from Ireland, gives us a glimpse of Baretti's bearing at
      Streatham. It is clear that Baretti was anxious to impress him with the
      nature of his position in the house. &ldquo;He told me he had several families
      both in town and country with whom he could go at any time and spend a
      month; he is at this time on these terms at Mr. Thrale's, and he knows how
      to keep his ground. Talking, as we were at tea, of the magnitude of the
      beer vessels, he said there was one thing at Mr. Thrale's house still more
      extraordinary&mdash;his wife. She gulped the pill very prettily. So much
      for Baretti!&rdquo; wrote the clergyman in a very illuminating account of his
      visit to Streatham.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not only did Mrs. Thrale bear with this detestable person for nearly
      two more years, but she and her husband took him with them and Johnson to
      Paris, where they lived in a magnificent way, the Thrales paying for
      everything. It was in a letter to Frank Levet, his domestic apothecary,
      that Johnson, writing from Paris, said: &ldquo;I ran a race in the rain this
      day, and beat Baretti. Baretti is a fine fellow.&rdquo; This is Johnson on
      Baretti. Here is Baretti on Johnson; on a copy of the <i>Piozzi Letters</i>
      he wrote: &ldquo;Johnson was often fond of saying silly things in strong terms,
      and the silly madam&rdquo;&mdash;meaning Mrs. Thrale&mdash;&ldquo;never failed to echo
      that beastly kind of wit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not, however, until an Italian tour, projected by Mr. Thrale, was
      postponed, that Baretti became quite unendurable. He had been presented by
      Mr. Thrale with £100 within a few months, and on the abandonment of the
      longer tour he received another £100 by way of compensation for the
      satisfaction he had been compelled to forgo in showing his countrymen the
      position to which he had attained in England. This was another act of
      generosity which he could not forgive. He became sullen and more
      cantankerous than ever, and neglected his duties in an intolerable way. In
      fact, he treated Streatham as if it were an hotel, turning up to give Miss
      Thrale a lesson at the most inconvenient hours, and then devoting the most
      of his time to poisoning the girl's mind against her mother. Upon one
      occasion he expressed the hope to her that if her mother died Mr. Thrale
      would marry Miss Whitbred, who would, he said, be a pretty companion for
      her, not tyrannical and overbearing as he affirmed her own mother was!
      Truly a nice remark for a young lady's tutor to make to her under her
      mother's roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, however&mdash;we have Baretti's own confession for it&mdash;that
      he had been led to believe that after being with the Thrales for a year or
      two, an annuity would be settled on him by the wealthy brewer, and he grew
      impatient at his services to the family not obtaining recognition in this
      way. It is extremely unlikely that Johnson ever even so much as hinted at
      this annuity, though Baretti says his expectations were due to what
      Johnson had told him; but it is certain that he had so exalted an opinion
      of himself, he believed that after a year or two of desultory teaching he
      should receive a handsome pension. And there the old story of the
      car-driver who left the nomination of the fare to &ldquo;his honour's honour&rdquo;
       was repeated. Baretti one morning packed up his bag and left Streatham
      without a word of farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson's account of his departure and his comments thereupon are worth
      notice. He wrote to Boswell:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baretti went away from Thrales in some whimsical fit of disgust or
      ill-nature without taking any leave. It is well if he finds in any other
      place as good an habitation and as many conveniences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the whole it is likely that a good many of Baretti's friends felt
      rather sorry than otherwise that the jury at the Old Bailey had taken so
      merciful a view of his accident. If Johnson and Murphy were really
      responsible for the line of defence which prevailed at the trial, one can
      quite believe that the Thrales and a good many of their associates bore
      them a secret grudge for their pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1782 he was granted by the Government the pension which he had
      failed to extort from the Thrales. It amounted to £80 per annum, and we
      may take it for granted that he had nothing but the most copious abuse for
      the Prime Minister who had only given him £80 when Sheridan was receiving
      £200 and Johnson £300. He drew his pension for seven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baretti's portrait, painted by Reynolds for the Streatham gallery, fetched
      £31 10s., the smallest price of any in the whole collection, on its
      dispersal, years after the principal actors in the scene in the &ldquo;awful
      Sessions House&rdquo; had gone to another world.

      THE FATAL GIFT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Mr. Boswell
      had been snubbed, and very soundly snubbed too, by a Duchess, one might
      fancy that his ambition was fully satisfied. But he was possibly the most
      persevering of the order of <i>Pachydermata</i> at that time extant; and
      in the matter of snubs he had the appetite of a leviathan. He was fired
      with the desire to be snubbed once more by Her Grace&mdash;and he was.
      Without waiting to catch her eye, he raised his glass and, bowing in her
      direction, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lady Duchess, I have the honour to drink Your Grace's good health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess did not allow her conversation with Dr. Johnson to be
      interrupted by so flagrant a piece of politeness; she continued chatting
      quite pleasantly to the great man, ignoring the little one. That was how
      she had got on in life; and, indeed, a better epitome of the whole art of
      getting on in life could scarcely be compiled even by the cynical nobleman
      who wrote letters to his son instructing him in this and other forms of
      progress&mdash;including the Rake's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boswell, who, as usual, is the pitiless narrator of the incident,
      records his satisfaction at having attained to the distinction of a snub
      from the beautiful creature at whose table he was sitting, and we are, as
      usual, deeply indebted to him for giving us an illuminating glimpse of the
      Duchess of whom at one time all England and the greater part of Ireland
      were talking. He also mentions that Her Grace made use of an idiom by
      which her Irish upbringing revealed itself. If we had not Mr. Boswell's
      account of his visit to Inveraray to refer to we might be tempted to
      believe that Horace Walpole deviated into accuracy when he attributed to
      the Duchess of Argyll, as well as her sister, the Countess of Coventry,
      the brogue of a bog-trotter. It was only by her employment of an idiom
      common to the south and west of Ireland and a few other parts of the
      kingdom, that Her Grace made him know that she had not been educated in
      England, or for that matter in Scotland, where doubtless Mr. Boswell
      fondly believed the purest English in the world was spoken.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Boswell faithfully records&mdash;sometimes with glee and occasionally
      with pride&mdash;many snubs which he received in the course of a lifetime
      of great pertinacity, and some that he omitted to note, his contemporaries
      were obliging enough to record; but on none did he reflect with more
      satisfaction than that, or those, which he suffered in the presence of the
      Duchess of Argyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened during that memorable tour to the Hebrides to which he lured
      Johnson in order to show his countrymen how great was his intimacy with
      the man who traduced them once in his Dictionary and daily in his life. It
      was like Boswell to expect that he would impress the Scottish nation by
      leading Johnson to view their fine prospects&mdash;he certainly was never
      foolish enough to hope to impress Johnson by introducing the Scottish
      nation to him. In due time, however, the exploiter and the exploited found
      themselves in the neighbourhood of Inveraray, the Duke of Argyll's Castle,
      and the stronghold of the Clan Campbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that the head of the great family was in residence at this
      time, and Mr. Boswell hastened to apprise him of the fact that the great
      Dr. Johnson was at hand. He called at the Castle very artfully shortly
      after the dinner hour, when he believed the Duchess and her daughter would
      have retired to a drawing-room. He was successful in finding the Duke
      still at the dinner-table, the ladies having retired. In the course of the
      interview the Duke said: &ldquo;Mr. Boswell, won't you have some tea?&rdquo; and Mr.
      Boswell, feeling sure that the Duchess could not go very far in insulting
      him when other people were present, followed his host into the
      drawing-room. &ldquo;The Duke,&rdquo; he records, &ldquo;announced my name, but the Duchess,
      who was sitting with her daughter, Lady Betty Hamilton, and some other
      ladies, took not the least notice of me. I should,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;have
      been mortified at being thus coldly received by a lady of whom I, with the
      rest of the world, have always entertained a very high admiration, had I
      not been consoled by the obliging attention of the Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was, indeed, obliging enough to invite Johnson to dinner the next
      day, and Mr. Boswell was included in the invitation. (So it is that the
      nursery governess gets invited to the table in the great house to which
      she is asked to bring the pretty children in her charge.) Of course,
      Boswell belonged to a good family, and his father was a judge. It was to a
      Duke of Argyll&mdash;not the one who was now so obliging&mdash;that the
      Laird of Auchinleck brought his son, James Boswell, to be examined in
      order to find out whether he should be put into the army or some other
      profession. Still, he would never have been invited to Inveraray at this
      time or any other unless he had had charge of Johnson. No one was better
      aware of this fact than Boswell; but did he therefore decline the
      invitation? Not he. Mr. Boswell saw an opportunity ahead of him. He had
      more than once heard Johnson give an account of how he had behaved when
      the King came upon him in the Royal Library; and probably he had felt
      melancholy at the reflection that he himself had had no part or lot in the
      incident. It was all Dr. Johnson and the King. But now he was quick to
      perceive that when, in after years, people should speak with bated breath
      of Dr. Johnson's visit to Inveraray they would be compelled to say: &ldquo;And
      Mr. Boswell, the son of auld Auchinleck, was there too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew very well that there were good reasons why Mr. Boswell could not
      hope to be a <i>persona grata</i> to the Duchess of Argyll. In the great
      Douglas lawsuit the issue of which was of considerable importance to the
      Duke of Hamilton, the son of Her Grace, the Boswells were on the side of
      the opposition, and had been very active on this side into the bargain.
      James Boswell himself narrowly escaped being committed for contempt of
      court for publishing a novel founded on the Douglas cause and anticipating
      in an impudent way the finding of the judges. Had the difference been
      directly with the Duke of Argyll some years earlier, no doubt every man in
      the Clan Campbell would have sharpened his skene when it became known that
      a friend of an opponent of the MacCallein More was coming, and have
      awaited his approach with complacency; but now the great chief tossed
      Boswell his invitation when he was asking Johnson, and Boswell jumped at
      it as a terrier jumps for a biscuit, and he accompanied his friend to the
      Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture which he paints of his second snubbing is done in his best
      manner. &ldquo;I was in fine spirits,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and though sensible that I had
      the misfortune of not being in favour with the Duchess, I was not in the
      least disconcerted, and offered Her Grace some of the dish which was
      before me.&rdquo; Later on he drank Her Grace's health, although, he adds, &ldquo;I
      knew it was the rule of modern high life not to drink to anybody.&rdquo; Thus he
      achieved the snub he sought; but he acknowledges that he thought the
      Duchess rather too severe when she said: &ldquo;I know nothing of Mr. Boswell.&rdquo;
       On reflection, however, he received &ldquo;that kind of consolation which a man
      would feel who is strangled by a silken cord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems strange that no great painter has been inspired by the theme and
      the scene. The days of &ldquo;subject pictures&rdquo; are, we are frequently told,
      gone by. This may be so, generally speaking, but every one knows that a
      &ldquo;subject picture,&rdquo; if its &ldquo;subject&rdquo; lends itself in any measure to the
      advertising of an article of commerce, will find a ready purchaser, so
      fine a perception of the aspirations of art&mdash;practical art&mdash;exists
      in England, and even in Scotland, in the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, are not the elements of success apparent to any one of imagination in
      this picture of the party sitting round the table in the great hall of
      Inveraray&mdash;Dr. Johnson chatting to the beautiful Duchess and her
      daughter at one side, the Duke looking uncomfortable at the other, when he
      sees Mr. Boswell on his feet with his glass in his hand bowing toward Her
      Grace? No doubt Her Grace had acquainted His Grace with the attitude she
      meant to assume in regard to Mi. Boswell, so that he was not astonished&mdash;only
      uncomfortable&mdash;when Mr. Boswell fished for his snub. Surely
      arrangements could be made between the art patron and the artist to paint
      a name and a certain brand upon the bottle&mdash;a bottle must, of course,
      be on the table; but if this is thought too realistic the name could
      easily be put on the decanter&mdash;from which Mr. Boswell has just
      replenished his glass! Why, the figure of Dr. Johnson alone should make
      the picture a success&mdash;i.e. susceptible of being reproduced as an
      effective poster in four printings. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;claret for
      boys, port for men, but brandy for heroes.&rdquo; Yes, but whose brandy? There
      is a hint for a great modern art patron&mdash;a twentieth-century art
      patron is a man who loves art for what he can make out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson was unmistakably the honoured guest this day at Inveraray; and
      perhaps, while the lovely Duchess hung upon his words of wisdom, his
      memory may have gone back to a day when he was not so well known, and yet
      by some accident found himself in a room with the then Duchess of Argyll.
      Upon that occasion he had thought it due to himself to be rude to the
      great lady, in response to some fancied remissness on her part. He had
      nothing to complain of now. The Duchess with whom he was conversing on
      terms of perfect equality&mdash;if Her Grace made any distinction between
      them it was, we may rest assured, only in a way that would be flattering
      to his learning&mdash;was at the head of the peerage for beauty, and there
      was no woman in the kingdom more honoured than she had been. He may have
      been among the crowds who hung about the Mall in St. James's Park
      twenty-two years before, waiting patiently until the two lovely Miss
      Gunnings should come forth from their house in Westminster to take the
      air. The Duchess of Argyll was the younger of the two sisters.

    <p>
      The story of the capture of the town by the pair of young Irish girls has
      been frequently told, and never without the word <i>romantic</i> being
      applied to it. But really there was very little that can be called
      romantic in the story of their success. There is far more of this element
      in many of the marriages affecting the peerage in these unromantic days.
      There is real romance in the story of a young duke's crossing the Atlantic
      with a single introduction, but that to the daughter of a millionaire with
      whom he falls madly in love and whom he marries as soon as the lawyers can
      make out the settlements. There is real romance in the idyll of the young
      marquis who is fortunate enough to win the affection of an ordinary chorus
      girl; and every year witnesses such-like alliances&mdash;they used to be
      called <i>mésalliances</i> long ago. There have also been instances of the
      daughters of English tradesmen marrying foreign nobles, whom they
      sometimes divorce as satisfactorily as if they were the daughters of
      wealthy swindlers on the other side of the Atlantic. In such cases there
      are portraits and paragraphs in some of the newspapers, and then people
      forget that anything unusual has happened. As a matter of fact, nothing
      unusual has happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the romantic story of the Gunnings we have no elements of that romance
      which takes the form of a <i>mésalliance</i>. Two girls, the
      granddaughters of one viscount and the nieces of another, came to London
      with their parents one year, and early the next married peers&mdash;the
      elder an earl, the younger a duke. Like thousands of other girls, they had
      no money; but, unlike hundreds of other girls who marry into the peerage,
      they were exceptionally good-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is there an element of romance in all this? The girls wedded men in
      their own station in life, and, considering their good looks, they should
      have done very much better for themselves. The duke was a wretched <i>roué</i>,
      notable for his excesses even in the days when excess was not usually
      regarded as noteworthy. He had ruined his constitution before he was
      twenty, and he remained enfeebled until, in a year or two, he made her a
      widow. The earl was a conceited, ill-mannered prig&mdash;a solemn,
      contentious, and self-opinionated person who was deservedly disliked in
      the town as well as the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a very brilliant marriage either of these. With the modern chorus girl
      the earl is on his knees at one side, and the gas man on the other. But
      with the Miss Gunnings it was either one peer or another. They were
      connected on their mother's side with at least two families of nobility,
      and on their father's side with the spiritual aristocracy of some
      generations back: they were collateral descendants of the great Peter
      Gunning, Chancellor of Oxford and Bishop of Ely, and he was able to trace
      his lineage back to the time of Henry VIII. From a brother of this great
      man was directly descended the father of the two girls and also Sir Robert
      Gunning, Baronet, who held such a high post in the diplomatic service as
      Minister Plenipotentiary to Berlin, and afterwards to St. Petersburg.
      Members of such families might marry into the highest order of the peerage
      without the alliance being criticised as &ldquo;romantic.&rdquo; The girls did not do
      particularly well for themselves. They were by birth entitled to the best,
      and by beauty to the best of the best. As it was, the one only became the
      wife of a contemptible duke, the other of a ridiculous earl. It may really
      be said that they threw themselves away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it was Walpole's gossip that is accountable for much of the
      false impression which prevailed in respect of the Gunnings. From the
      first he did his best to disparage them. He wrote to Mann that they were
      penniless, and &ldquo;scarce gentlewomen.&rdquo; He could not ignore the fact that
      their mother was the Honourable Bridget Gunning; but, without knowing
      anything of the matter, he undertook to write about the &ldquo;inferior tap&rdquo; on
      their father's side. In every letter that he wrote at this time he tried
      to throw ridicule upon them, alluding to them as if they were nothing
      better than the barefooted colleens of an Irish mountain-side who had come
      to London to seek their fortunes. As usual, he made all his letters
      interesting to his correspondents by introducing the latest stories
      respecting them; he may not have invented all of these, but some
      undoubtedly bear the Strawberry Hill mark, and we know that Walpole never
      suppressed a good tale simply because it possessed no grain of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the true story of the Gunnings can be ascertained without any
      reference to Walpole's correspondence. Both girls were born in England&mdash;the
      elder, Maria, in 1731, the younger in 1732. When they were still young
      their father, a member of the English Bar, inherited his brother's Irish
      property. It had once been described as a &ldquo;tidy estate,&rdquo; but it was now in
      a condition of great untidiness. In this respect it did not differ
      materially from the great majority of estates in Ireland. Ever since the
      last &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; the country had been in a most unsettled condition, and
      no part of it was worse than the County Roscommon, where Castle Coote, the
      residence of the Gunning family, was situated. It might perhaps be going
      too far to say that the wilds of Connaught were as bad as the wilds of
      Yorkshire at the same date, but from all the information that can be
      gathered on the subject there does not seem to have been very much to
      choose between Roscommon and the wilder parts of Yorkshire. The peasantry
      were little better than savages; the gentry were little worse. Few of the
      elements of civilized life were to be found among the inhabitants. The
      nominal owners of the land were content to receive tribute from their
      tenantry in the form of the necessaries of life, for money as a standard
      of exchange was rarely available. Even in the present day in many
      districts in the west of Ireland cattle occupy the same place in the
      imagination of the inhabitants as they do in Zululand. The Irish bride is
      bargained away with so many cows; and for a man to say&mdash;as one did in
      the very county of Roscommon the other day&mdash;that he never could see
      the difference of two cows between one girl and another, may be reckoned
      somewhat cynical, but it certainly is intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if rent was owing&mdash;and it usually was&mdash;and if it was not
      paid in the form of geese, or eggs, or pork, or some other products of low
      farming and laziness, it remained unpaid; for the landlord had no means of
      enforcing his claims by any law except the law of the jungle. He might
      muster his followers and plunder his debtors, and no doubt this system of
      rent-collecting prevailed for several years after one of the many
      &ldquo;settlements&rdquo; of the country had taken place, yet by intermarriage with
      the natives, and a general assimilation to their condition of life by the
      newcomers, these raids for rent became unpopular and impracticable. The
      consequence was that the landlords&mdash;such as remained on their estates&mdash;were
      living from hand to mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the fact that the King's writ failed to run in these parts was of
      disadvantage to the landlords in one respect, it was of no inconsiderable
      advantage to them in another; for it enabled them with a light heart to
      contract debts in Dublin and in the chief towns. They knew that the
      rascally process server, should he have the hardihood to make any attempt
      to present them with the usual summons, would do so at the risk of his
      life; and a knowledge of this fact made the &ldquo;gentry&rdquo; at once reckless and
      lawless. The consequence was that Ireland was regarded as no place for a
      man with any respect for his neighbours or for himself to live in. It
      became the country of the agent and the squireen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to one of the worst parts of this country that John Gunning brought
      his wife and four children&mdash;the eldest was eight years and the
      youngest three months&mdash;and here he tried to support them off the
      &ldquo;estate.&rdquo; He might possibly have succeeded if his aspirations had been
      humble and his property unencumbered. It so happened, however, that his
      father had been the parent of sixteen children, and the estate was still
      charged with the maintenance of ten of these. Thus hampered, Mr. Gunning
      and the Honourable Bridget Gunning were compelled to adopt the mode of
      life of the other gentry who were too poor to live out of Ireland, and
      they allowed the education of their family to become a minor consideration
      to that of feeding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gunning and his wife were undoubtedly the originals of the type of
      Irish lady and gentleman to be found in so many novels and plays of the
      latter part of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth
      centuries. He was the original &ldquo;heavy father&rdquo; who, with the addition of a
      ridiculous nondescript brogue, was so effectively dealt with by numerous
      writers until Thackeray took him in hand; and Mrs. Gunning was the first
      of the tradition of Irish mothers with daughters to dispose of by the aid
      of grand manners and a great deal of contriving. True to this tradition,
      which originated with them, the lady was certainly the head of the
      household&mdash;a sorry household it must have been at Castle Coote&mdash;during
      the ten years that elapsed before the migration to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gunning was a fine figure of a gentleman, a handsome, loquacious
      person with a great sense of his own dignity and an everlasting
      consciousness of the necessity to maintain it at something approximate to
      its proper level, and, like other persons of the same stamp, never
      particularly successful in the means employed to effect this object. It is
      doubtful if a loud conversational style, with repeated references to the
      brilliant past of his family and predictions as to the still more
      brilliant future that would have been achieved by its representative but
      for the outrageous fortune that flung him into the bogs of Roscommon,
      produced a more vivid impression upon his associates in Ireland than it
      would be likely to do among a more credulous community. In Ireland he
      resembled the young gentleman who went to educate the French, but was
      discouraged at the outset when he found that even the children in the
      streets spoke better French than he did. Mr. Gunning could teach the Irish
      squireens nothing in the way of boasting; and he soon found that they were
      capable of giving him some valuable instruction as to the acquiring of
      creditors and their subsequent evasion. Whatever their educational
      deficiencies may have been, it must be admitted that they had mastered
      these arts. Much as he despised his ancestral home, he found, after
      repeated visits to Dublin, that his heart was, after all, in Castle Coote,
      and that, for avoiding arrest for debt, there was no place like home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable Mrs. Gunning must have become dreadfully tired of this
      florid person and of the constant worry incidental to the control of such
      a household as his must have been. Her life must have been spent
      contriving how the recurrent crises could be averted, and so long as she
      was content to remain in the seclusion of the Irish village her efforts
      were successful. We do not hear that the bailiffs ever got so far as the
      hall door of their ramshackle mansion; there was a bog very handy, and the
      holes which served as a rudimentary system of natural drainage were both
      deep and dark. The topography of the district was notoriously puzzling to
      the officers from the Dublin courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with all her success in this direction one maybe pretty sure that her
      life must have been very burthensome to the Honourable Mrs. Gunning. She
      had social ambitions, as befitted a daughter of a noble house, and on this
      account she never allowed herself to sink to the level of the wives of the
      squireens around her, who were quite content with the rude jollity of an
      Irish household&mdash;with the &ldquo;lashings and leavings&rdquo; to eat, and with
      the use of tumblers instead of wineglasses at table. She was the daughter
      of a peer, and she never forgot this fact; and here it must be mentioned
      that, however culpably she may have neglected the education of her
      children in some respects, she took care that they avoided the provincial
      brogue of their Irish neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was because Walpole knew nothing of the tradition of the
      English settlers in Ireland that he referred in his letters to various
      correspondents to the appalling brogue of both the Gunning girls; or
      perhaps he, as usual, aimed only at making his correspondence more amusing
      by this device. But every one who knows something of the &ldquo;settlements&rdquo; is
      aware of the fact that the new-comers had such a contempt for the native
      way of pronouncing English that they were most strenuous in their efforts
      to hand down to their children the tradition of pronunciation which they
      brought into the country. They were not always so successful as they
      wished to be; but within our own times the aspiration after a pure
      &ldquo;English accent&rdquo; is so great that even in the National Schools the
      teachers, the larger number of whom bear Celtic names, have been most
      industrious both in getting rid of their native brogue and in compelling
      their pupils to do the same; and yet it is certain that people have been
      much more tolerant in this respect in Ireland during the past half-century
      than they were a hundred years earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, a scientific analysis of the pronunciation of the English
      language by, say, a native of the wilds of Yorkshire and by a native of
      the wilds of Connemara would reveal the fact that fewer corruptions of the
      speech are habitual to the latter than to the former, the &ldquo;brogue&rdquo; being
      far less corrupt than the &ldquo;burr.&rdquo; It was not enough for the settlers,
      however, that their children should speak English in Ireland more
      correctly than their forefathers did in England; they insisted on the
      maintenance of the English tradition of pronunciation, erroneous though it
      might be. So that the suggestion that the daughters of the Gunning family,
      who had never heard English spoken with the brogue of the native Irish
      until they were eight or nine years of age, spoke the tongue of the stage
      Irish peasant would seem quite ridiculous to any one who had given even
      the smallest amount of study to the conditions of speech prevailing in
      Ireland even in the present tolerant age, when employment is not denied to
      any one speaking with the broadest of brogues. Some years ago such an
      applicant would have had no chance of a &ldquo;billet&rdquo;&mdash;unless, in a
      literal sense, to hew, with the alternative of the drawing of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth, then, is that the Gunning girls had practically neither more
      nor less of that form of education to be acquired from the study of books
      or &ldquo;lessons&rdquo; than the average young woman of their own day who had been
      &ldquo;neglected.&rdquo; Between the years 1750 and 1800 there were in England
      hundreds of young ladies who were as highly educated as a junior-grade
      lady clerk in the Post Office Department is to-day; but there were also
      thousands who were as illiterate as the Gunnings without any one thinking
      that it mattered much one way or another.

      And it really did not matter much that Maria Gunning spelt as vaguely as
      did Shakespere, or Shakspere, or Shakespeare, or Shakspear, or whatever he
      chose to write himself at the moment. Correctness of orthography is
      absolutely necessary for any young lady who wishes to be a success in the
      Postal Department, but Miss Gunning possessed some qualifications of
      infinitely greater importance in the estimation of the world. She was of
      good family and she was beautiful exceedingly. Moreover, she possessed the
      supreme grace of naturalness&mdash;the supreme grace and that which
      includes all other graces, which, like butterflies, hover over womankind,
      but seldom descend in a bevy upon any one of the race. She was as natural
      as a lily flower, and for the same reason. To be natural il came to her by
      Nature, and that was how she won the admiration of more people than the
      beauty of Helen of Troy brought to their death. She was not wise. But had
      she been wise she would never have left Ireland. She would have known that
      obscurity is the best friend that any young woman so beautiful as she was
      could have. She would have remained in Roscommon, and she would have been
      one of those women who are happy because they have no story. But, of
      course, had she been wise she would not have been natural, and so there
      her beauty goes by the board in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable Mrs. Gunning could not have been startled when the
      knowledge came to her that she was the mother of two girls of exceptional
      beauty. The same knowledge comes to every mother of two girls in the
      world, though this knowledge is sometimes withheld from the rest of the
      world; but even then the mother's faith is not shaken&mdash;except in
      regard to the eyesight of the rest of the world. Doubtless Mrs. Gunning
      thought much better of Ireland when she found that her judgment on the
      beauty of her daughters was shared by all the people who saw the girls.
      From the daily exclamation of wonder&mdash;the exaggerated expressions of
      appreciation uttered by a fervent peasantry&mdash;when the girls were seen
      in their own kitchen or on the roadside, the mother's ambition must have
      received a fresh stimulus. And given an ambitious mother, whose life has
      been one of contriving to do things that seem out of her power to
      accomplish, the achievement of her object is only a matter of time&mdash;provided
      that the father does not become an obstruction. Mrs. Gunning was not
      extravagant in her longings. Her Delectable Mountains were those which
      surround the City of Dublin. Her social ambitions did not extend beyond
      &ldquo;The Castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the eldest of her three daughters was scarcely nineteen the
      aggregation of savings and credit&mdash;the latter predominant&mdash;seemed
      sufficient to justify the expedition. A house was taken in a fashionable
      street, close to the most splendid Mall in Europe, and furnished by some
      credulous tradesmen, and the social campaign was begun by a parade of the
      two girls and their mother. Alas! the young beauties attracted only too
      much attention. The inquiries as to their style and title were
      unfortunately not limited. In Dublin for generations the tradespeople have
      been accustomed to take an intelligent and quite intelligible interest in
      the aristocracy and beauty dwelling in their midst; and it took only a few
      days for the report to go round that the exquisite young ladies were the
      daughters of Mr. John Gunning, of Castle Coote.
    </p>
    <p>
      This information meant much more to some of the least desirable of the
      inquirers than it did to the wealthy and well connected of the population;
      and among the least desirable of all were some tradesmen who for years had
      had decrees waiting to be executed against Mr. Gunning at a more
      convenient place for such services than Castle Coote. The result was that
      within a week the beauty of his daughters had made such a stir in Dublin
      that bailiffs were in the house and Mr. Gunning was out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at this point in the history that the Troubadour unslings his lute,
      feeling the potentialities of Romance in the air; and, given the
      potentialities of Romance and the wandering minstrel, one may be sure that
      the atmosphere will resound with Romance. We are told on such high
      authority as is regarded quite satisfactory (by the Troubadour), that the
      weeping of the mother and the beautiful girls under the coarse stare of
      the bailiffs attracted the attention of a charming and sympathetic young
      actress who was taking the air in the street, and that, as might only be
      expected, she hastened to enter the house to offer consolation to those
      who were in trouble&mdash;this being unquestionably the mission which is
      most congenial to the spirit of the <i>soubrette</i>. On being at once
      informed of all by the communicative mother&mdash;the Troubadour is not
      such a fool as to lay down his lute to inquire if it was likely that a
      lady who possessed her full share of Irish pride would open her heart to a
      stranger and an actress&mdash;the young visitor showed her sympathy by
      laying herself open to prosecution and imprisonment through helping in a
      scheme to make away with all the valuables she could lay her hands on. But
      she went still further, and invited the young ladies to stay at her house
      so long as it suited them to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are told that this young actress was George Ann Bellamy, but the
      information comes from no better source than George Ann Bellamy herself,
      and the statements of this young person, made when she was no longer young
      or reputable, do not carry conviction to all hearers. Romance, however,
      like youth, will not be denied, though the accuracy of an actress may, and
      people have always been pleased to believe that Miss Bellamy and Mr.
      Thomas Sheridan, the much-harassed lessee of the Smock Alley Theatre in
      Dublin, were the means of obtaining for the Honourable Mrs. Gunning and
      her daughters the invitation to the ball at the Castle which resulted in
      the recognition of the girls' beauty by the great world of fashion. The
      suggestion that their aunt, Miss Bourke, or their uncle, Viscount Mayo,
      might have been quite as potent a factor in solving the problem of how the
      invitation to a ball given by the Viceroy to the people of Dublin came
      into the hands of the Miss Gunnings, may, however, be worth a moment's
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, the success made by the girls upon this occasion was
      immediate. Before a day had passed all Dublin and Dublin Castle were
      talking of their beauty, and the splendid Mall was crowded with people
      anxious to catch a glimpse of the lovely pair when they took their walks
      abroad. Lady Caroline Petersham, the charming lady whose name figures
      frequently in Walpole's correspondence&mdash;it will be remembered that
      she was one of that delightful little supper party at Ranelagh which he
      describes&mdash;was in the entourage of the Viceroy, and quickly perceived
      the possibilities of social prestige accruing to the hostess who might be
      the means of introducing them to St. James's. There a new face meant a new
      sensation lasting sometimes well into a second month, and Lady Caroline
      had her ambitions as a hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the Gunnings' best friend&mdash;assuming that social advancement
      is an act of friendship&mdash;and it may safely be assumed that she was
      mainly responsible for the extension of the area of the campaign entered
      on by Mrs. Gunning, and that it was her influence which obtained for them
      the passage to Chester in the Lord Lieutenant's yacht, and a bonus of £150
      charged, as so many other jobs were, &ldquo;upon the Irish Establishment.&rdquo; The
      &ldquo;Irish Establishment&rdquo; was the convenient Treasury out of which money could
      be paid without the chance of unpleasant questions being asked in
      Parliament respecting such disbursements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it is not to be believed that such success as the young girls
      encompassed in Dublin was reached without a word or two of detraction
      being heard in regard to their behaviour. Mrs. Delany, amiable as a moral
      gossip, or perhaps, a gossipy moralist, wrote to her sister respecting
      them: &ldquo;All that you have heard of the Gunnings is true, except their
      having a fortune, but I am afraid they have a greater want than that,
      which is discretion.&rdquo; No doubt Mrs. Delany had heard certain whispers of
      the girlish fun in which the elder of the sisters delighted; but there has
      never been the smallest suggestion that her want of discreetness ever
      approached an actual indiscretion. It may be assumed, without doing an
      injustice to either of the girls, that their standard of demeanour was not
      quite so elevated as that which the wife of Dean Delany was disposed to
      regard as essential to be reached by any young woman hoping to be thought
      well of by her pastors and masters. But the steelyard measure was never
      meant to be applied to a high-spirited young girl who has grown up among
      bogs and then finds herself the centre of the most distinguished circle in
      the land, every person in which is eagerly striving for the distinction of
      a word from her lips. Maria Gunning may not have had much discretion, but
      she had enough to serve her turn. She arrived in London with her sister,
      and no suggestion was ever made&mdash;even by Walpole&mdash;that their
      mother had not taken enough care of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In London they at once found their place in the centre of the most
      fashionable&mdash;the most notorious&mdash;set; but while we hear of the
      many indiscreet things that were done by certain of their associates,
      nothing worse is attributed to either of the girls than an Irish brogue or
      an Irish idiom&mdash;perhaps a word or two that sounded unmusical to
      fastidious ears. Walpole began by ridiculing them, and, as has already
      been noted, sneering at their birth; but when he found they were becoming
      the greatest social success that his long day had known, he thought it
      prudent to trim his sails and refer to them more reasonably: they were
      acquiring too many friends for it to be discreet for him to continue
      inventing gossip respecting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a triumph they achieved in town! Nothing had ever been known like
      it in England, nor has anything approaching to it been known during the
      century and a half that has elapsed since the beauty of these two girls
      captured London. The opening of Parliament by the King in State never
      attracted such crowds as thronged the Park when they walked in the Mall.
      Never before had the guards to turn out at the Palace to disperse the
      crowds who mobbed two young ladies who did not belong&mdash;except in a
      distant way&mdash;to a Royal House. Upon one occasion the young Lord
      Clermont and his friend were compelled to draw their swords to protect
      them from the exuberant attentions of the crowd. &ldquo;'Tis a warm day,&rdquo; wrote
      George Selwyn to Lord Carlisle, &ldquo;and some one proposes a stroll to Betty's
      fruit shop; suddenly the cry is raised, 'The Gunnings are coming,' and we
      all tumble out to gaze and to criticise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The famous beauties are more talked of than the change in the Ministry,&rdquo;
       wrote Walpole. &ldquo;They make more noise than any one of their predecessors
      since Helen of Troy; a crowd follows them wherever they walk, and at
      Vauxhall they were driven away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This mobbing must have caused the girls much delightful inconvenience, and
      one can see their mother acting the part&mdash;and overdoing it, after the
      manner of her kind&mdash;of the distracted parent whose daughters have
      just been restored to her arms. One can hear the grandiloquent thanks of
      the father to the eligible young man with titles whose bravery has
      protected his offspring&mdash;that would have been his word&mdash;from the
      violence of the mob. The parents must have been very trying to the young
      men in those days. But the mother showed herself to be rather more than a
      match for one young man who hoped to win great fame as a jocular fellow by
      playing a trick upon the family. Having heard of the simplicity and
      credulousness of the girls, this gentleman, with another of his kind,
      asked leave of Mrs. Gunning to bring to her house a certain duke who was
      one of the greatest <i>partis</i> of the day. On her complying, he hired a
      common man, and, dressing him splendidly, conveyed him in a coach to the
      Gunnings' house and presented him to the family as the duke. But the man
      knew as little of the matter as did Walpole; he assumed that she was
      nothing more than the adventurous wife of an Irish squireen. He soon found
      out that he had made a mistake. Mrs. Gunning rang the bell, and ordered
      the footman to turn the visitors out of the house. But the family were
      soon consoled for this incident of the impostor duke by the arrival of a
      real one, to say nothing of another consolation prize in the form of an
      earl. In the meantime, however, their popularity-had been increasing
      rather than diminishing. As a matter of fact, although beauty may be
      reproached for being only skin deep, it is very tenacious of life. A
      reputation for beauty is perhaps the most enduring of all forms of
      notoriety. The renown that attaches to the man who has painted a great
      picture, or to one who has made a great scientific discovery, or to one
      who has been an eminent churchman or a distinguished statesman, is, in
      point of popularity and longevity, quite insignificant in comparison with
      that which is associated with the name of a very beautiful woman. The
      crowds still surrounded the Miss Gunnings, and the visit which they paid
      by command to King George II gave them a position in the world of fashion
      that was consolidated by the report of the charming <i>naivete</i> of the
      reply made by Maria when the King inquired if they had seen all the sights
      of London and if there was any in particular which they would like to be
      shown. &ldquo;Oh, I should dearly like to see a coronation!&rdquo; the girl is said to
      have cried. And as that was just the sight for which the people of England
      were most eager, she was acclaimed as their mouthpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they progressed in the career that had been laid out for them. Duels
      were fought about them, and bets were made about them and their future.
      For nearly a year there was no topic of the first order save only the
      Progress of Beauty. The Duke had come boldly forward. He was a double duke&mdash;his
      titles were Hamilton and Brandon&mdash;and he had sounded such depths of
      depravity that he was possibly sincere in his desire to convince the world
      that his taste in one direction had not become depraved. Elizabeth Gunning
      may have accepted his service from a hope of being the means of reforming
      him. But even if she were not to succeed in doing so, her mother would
      have reminded her that her failure would not make her the less a duchess.
      It is open, however, for one to believe that this girl cared something for
      the man and was anxious to amend his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we hear of her being with him at Lord Chesterfield's ball given at
      the opening of his new mansion, her fancy dress being that of a Quakeress.
      Three days later the world in which they lived awoke to learn the
      astounding news that the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon had married
      Elizabeth Gunning the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was romance beyond a precedent; and Walpole romanced about it as
      usual. In his account of the nuptials he succeeds in making more
      misstatements than one would believe it possible even for such a worker in
      the art to encompass in half a dozen lines. &ldquo;When her mother and sister
      were at Bedford House,&rdquo; he wrote to Mann, &ldquo;a sudden ardour, either of wine
      or love, seized upon him (the Duke); a parson was promptly sent for, but
      on arriving, refused to officiate without the important essentials of
      licence or ring. The Duke swore and talked of calling in the Archbishop.
      Finally the parson's scruples gave way, the licence was overlooked, and
      the lack of the traditional gold ring was supplied by the ring of a bed
      curtain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is very amusing, but it is not history. It is a clumsy fiction,
      unworthy of the resources of the inventor. Sir Horace Mann must have felt
      that his friend had a poor opinion of his intelligence if he meant him to
      accept the assurance that the household of the Gunnings and the fingers of
      His Grace were incapable of yielding to the fastidious parson a better
      substitute for the traditional gold ring than the thing he introduced. The
      facts of the incident were quite romantic enough without the need for
      Walpole's embellishments. It was Valentine's Day, and what more likely
      than that the suggestion should be made by the ardent lover that so
      appropriate a date for a wedding would not come round for another year! To
      suggest difficulties&mdash;impossibility&mdash;would only be to spur him
      on to show that he was a true lover. However this may be, it has long ago
      been proved that the midnight marriage took place in due form at the
      Curzon Street Chapel in the presence of several witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Walpole went on to say that the wedding of Lord Coventry and the
      elder sister took place at the same time. It so happened, however, that a
      fortnight elapsed between the two ceremonies, and in the case of the
      second, the ceremony took place in the full light of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subsequent history of the two ladies is not without a note of
      melancholy. The elder, pursued to the end by the malevolent slanders of
      the man with the leer of the satyr perpetually on his face, died of
      consumption after eight years of wedded life. The younger became a widow
      two years earlier, and after being wooed by the Duke of Bridgewater, whom
      she refused, sending him to his canal for consolation, married Colonel
      Campbell, who in 1770 became the Fifth Duke of Argyll. Six years later she
      was created a peeress in her own right, her title being Baroness Hamilton
      of Hameldon in Leicestershire. In 1778 she was appointed Mistress of the
      Robes. She attained to the additional distinction of making the good Queen
      jealous, so that Her Majesty upon one occasion overlooked her in favour of
      Lady Egremont. The Duchess at once resigned, and only with difficulty was
      persuaded to withdraw her resignation. She died in 1790.

    <h2>
      THE FÊTE-CHAMPÊTRE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>O one knows to-day
      with whom the idea of having an English <i>fête-champêtre</i> at The Oaks
      upon the occasion of the marriage of the young Lord Stanley to Lady Betty
      Hamilton originated. The secret was well kept; and it can be easily
      understood that in case of this innovation proving a fiasco, no one would
      show any particular desire to accept the responsibility of having started
      the idea. But turning out as it did, a great success, it might have been
      expected that many notable persons would lay claim to be regarded as its
      parents. A considerable number of distinguished people had something to do
      with it, and any one of them had certainly sufficient imagination, backed
      up by an acquaintance with some of the exquisite pieces of MM. Watteau and
      Fragonard, to suggest the possibility of perfecting such an enterprise
      even in an English June. It was the most diligent letter-writer of that
      age of letter-writing who had referred to the &ldquo;summer setting in with its
      customary severity,&rdquo; so that the trifling of the month of June with the
      assumption of the poets who have rhymed of its sunshine with rapture, was
      not an experience that was reserved for the century that followed. But in
      spite of this, the idea of a <i>fête-champêtre</i>, after the most
      approved French traditions, in an English demesne found favour in the eyes
      of Lord Stanley and his advisers, and the latter were determined that,
      whatever price might have to be paid for it, they would not run the chance
      of being blamed for carrying it out in a niggardly spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Lord Stanley had as many advisers as any young nobleman with a
      large immediate allowance and prospects of a splendid inheritance may hope
      to secure. There was his <i>fiancée's</i> mother, now the Duchess of
      Argyll, who was never disposed to frown down an undertaking that would
      place a member of one of her families in the forefront of the battle of
      the beauties for the most desirable <i>parti</i> of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0155.jpg" alt="0155 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0155.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The Duchess had both taste and imagination, so that people called her an
      Irishwoman, although she was born in England. Then there was Mr. George
      Selwyn, who said witty things occasionally and never missed a hanging. He
      was fully qualified to prompt a wealthy companion as to the best means to
      become notorious for a day. There was also young Mr. Conway, the gentleman
      who originated the diverting spectacle when Mrs. Baddeley and Mrs.
      Abington were escorted to the Pantheon. Any one of these, to say nothing
      of Lady Betty herself, who had some love for display, might have been
      inclined to trust an English June so far as to believe an <i>al fresco</i>
      entertainment on a splendid scale quite possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, however, one is inclined to believe that it was Colonel
      Burgoyne who was responsible for the whole scheme at The Oaks. In addition
      to having become Lord Stanley's uncle by running away with his father's
      sister, he was a budding dramatist, and as such must have perceived his
      opportunity for exploiting himself at the expense of some one else&mdash;the
      dream of every budding dramatist. There is every likelihood that it was
      this highly accomplished and successful &ldquo;gentleman-adventurer&rdquo; who brought
      Lord Stanley up to the point of embarking upon his design for an
      entertainment such as had never been seen in England before&mdash;an
      entertainment that should include the production of a masque devised by
      Colonel Burgoyne and entitled <i>The Maid of The Oaks</i>. The fête came
      off, and it was pronounced the most brilliant success of the year 1774.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Stanley was a very interesting young man; that is to say, he was a
      young man in whom no inconsiderable number of persons&mdash;mainly of the
      opposite sex&mdash;were greatly interested. Of this fact he seems to have
      been fully aware. A good many people&mdash;mainly of the opposite sex&mdash;felt
      very strongly on the subject of his marrying: it was quite time that he
      married, they said. His grandfather, the Earl of Derby, was eighty-four
      years of age, and it would be absurd to believe that he could live much
      longer. Lord Stanley being his heir, it was agreed that it was the young
      man's duty not to procrastinate in the matter of marriage. It is always
      understood that a patriarchal nobleman sings &ldquo;<i>Nunc dimittis</i>&rdquo; when
      he holds in his arms the second in direct succession to the title, and
      this happy consummation could, in the case of the aged Lord Derby, only be
      realised by the marriage of Lord Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was small in stature, and extremely plain of countenance; still this
      did not prevent his name from being coupled with that of several notable&mdash;but
      not too notable&mdash;young women of his acquaintance. But as it was well
      known that he was greatly interested in the stage, it was thought that,
      perhaps, he might not be so complaisant as his best friends hoped to find
      him in regard to marrying. An ardent interest in the progress of the
      drama, especially in its lighter forms, has been known to turn a young
      man's attention from marriage, when it does not do what is far worse&mdash;turn
      his attention to it with too great zest. Before long, however, it became
      apparent that his lordship recognised in what direction his duty lay.
      There was a young lady connected with the Ducal House of Bedford&mdash;a
      niece of that old Duchess who played so conspicuous a part in the social
      and political history of the middle of the eighteenth century&mdash;and to
      her Lord Stanley became devoted. But just when every one assumed that the
      matter was settled, no one thinking it possible that the young lady would
      be mad enough to refuse such a <i>parti</i>, the news came that she had
      done so; and before people had done discussing how very eccentric were the
      Bedford connections, the announcement was made that Lord Stanley was to
      marry Lady Betty Hamilton, the beautiful daughter of a beautiful mother,
      the Duchess of Argyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in existence a letter written by the Duchess to Sir William
      Hamilton, in which she hints that Lord Stanley was an old suitor for the
      hand of her daughter. &ldquo;Lady Betty might have taken the name of Stanley
      long ago if she had chose it,&rdquo; she wrote, adding: &ldquo;A very sincere
      attachment on his side has at last produced the same on hers.&rdquo; This being
      so, it would perhaps be unsafe to assume that Lord Stanley proposed to
      Lady Betty out of pique at having been rejected by the other lady, though
      one might be disposed to take this view of the engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alternative view is that Lady Betty had been advised by her
      accomplished mother that if she played her cards well there was no reason
      why she should not so attract Lord Stanley as to lead him to be a suitor
      for her hand, and that the girl at last came to see that the idea was
      worth her consideration. Her portrait, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in
      the year of her marriage, shows her to have been a graceful, girlish young
      creature; but her beauty could never have been comparable with that of her
      mother at the same age, or with that of her aunt, Lady Coventry, whom it
      is certain she closely resembled in character. Her mother, in her letter
      to Sir William Hamilton, apologises in a way for her liveliness, assuring
      him that such a disposition was not incompatible with serious thought upon
      occasions; and this gives us a hint that the reputation for vivacity which
      she always enjoyed was closely akin to that which made the life of Lady
      Coventry so very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the young lady in whose honour the first English <i>fête
      champêtre</i> was organised. To be more exact, or to get more into touch
      with the view of the Derby family, perhaps one should say that the <i>fête</i>
      was set on foot in consideration of the honour the young lady was doing
      herself in becoming a member of the great house of Stanley. Different
      people look at a question of honour from different standpoints. Probably
      Colonel Burgoyne, although a member of the Derby family by marriage, left
      honour out of the question altogether, and only thought of his masque
      being produced at his nephew's expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      And produced the masque was, and on a scale as expensive as the most
      ambitious author could desire. It was described, with comments, by all the
      great letter-writers of the time. Walpole has his leer and his sneer at
      its expense (literally). It was to cost no less than £5000, he said, and
      he ventured to suppose that in order to account for this enormous outlay
      Lord Stanley had bought up all the orange trees near London&mdash;no
      particular extravagance one would fancy&mdash;and that the hay-cocks would
      be of straw-coloured riband. George Selwyn thought it far from diverting.
      The Dowager Lady Gower affirmed that &ldquo;all the world was there,&rdquo; only she
      makes an exception of her relations the Bedfords&mdash;she called them
      &ldquo;the Bloomsbury lot&rdquo;&mdash;and said that the Duchess would not let any of
      them go because Her Grace thought that Lord Stanley should have taken his
      recent rejection by Her Grace's niece more to heart. Lady Betty's
      stepfather, the Duke of Argyll, said that the whole day was so long and
      fatiguing that only Lady Betty could have stood it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did Lady Betty stand it all? It was rumoured in the best-informed
      circles that she had broken off the match the next day; and when one
      becomes acquainted with the programme of the day's doings one cannot but
      acknowledge that the rumour was plausible. She probably made an attempt in
      this direction; but on her fiancé's promising never to repeat the offence,
      withdrew her resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous brothers Adam, whose genius was equally ready to build an
      Adelphi or to design a fanlight, had been commissioned to plan an
      entertainment on the most approved French models and to carry it out on
      the noblest scale, taking care, of course, that the central idea should be
      the masque of <i>The Maid of The Oaks</i>, and these large-minded artists
      accepted the order without demur. The pseudo-classical feeling entered,
      largely through the influence of the Adams, into every form of art at this
      period, though the famous brothers cannot be accused of originating the
      movement. Sir Joshua Reynolds painted his most charming ladies in the
      costume of Greeks, and Angelica Kauffmann depicted many of her early
      English episodes with the personages clad in togas which seemed greatly
      beyond their control. But for that matter every battle piece up to the
      date of Benjamin West's &ldquo;Death of Wolfe&rdquo; showed the combatants in
      classical armour; and Dr. Johnson was more than usually loud in his
      protests against the suggestion that a sculptor should put his statues of
      modern men into modern clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Adams were wise enough to refrain from issuing any order as to the
      costume to be worn by the shepherds and shepherdesses who were to roam the
      mead at The Oaks, Epsom, upon the occasion of this <i>fête champêtre</i>;
      and they were also wise enough to distrust the constancy of an English
      June. The result was (1) a charming medley of costume, though the
      pseudo-pastoral peasants, farmers, gardeners, and shepherds were in the
      majority, and (2) the most interesting part of the entertainments took
      place indoors, the octagonal hall lending itself nobly&mdash;when improved
      by Messrs. Adam&mdash;to the show. The &ldquo;transparencies&rdquo; which constituted
      so important a part of the ordinary birthday celebrations of the time,
      took the form of painted windows, and, later, of a device showing two of
      the conventional torches of Hymen in full blaze, supporting a shield with
      the Oak of the Hamiltons' crest and the usual &ldquo;gules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This design occupied the place of the &ldquo;set piece&rdquo; which winds up a modern
      display of fireworks and sets the band playing &ldquo;God save the King.&rdquo; It
      could not have been brought on until the morning sunlight was flooding the
      landscape outside; for supper was not served until half-past eleven, and
      the company had to witness the representation of an intolerably long
      masque&mdash;the second of the day&mdash;after supper, with a procession
      of Druids, fauns, cupids, and nymphs, all in suitable, but it is to be
      hoped not traditional, costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entertainment began quite early in the afternoon, when there was a
      long procession of shepherds and shepherdesses through the lanes to where
      a pastoral play was produced and syllabub drunk under the trees. But this
      was only an <i>hors d'ouvre</i>; it was not Colonel Burgoyne's
      masterpiece. This was not produced in the open air. Only when further
      refreshments had been served and evening was closing in did the guests,
      who had been sauntering through the sylvan scenes, repair to the great
      hall, which they found superbly decorated and, in fact, remodelled, for
      colonnades after the type of those in the pictures of Claude had been
      built around the great ballroom, the shafts being festooned with roses,
      and the drapery of crimson satin with heavy gold fringes. There were not
      enough windows to make excuses for so much drapery, but this was no
      insuperable obstacle to the artful designers; they so disposed of the
      material as to make it appear that it was the legitimate hanging for six
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the procession through the colonnades the young host changed his
      costume and his fiancée changed hers. He had appeared as Rubens and she as
      Rubens' wife, from the well-known picture. But now she was dressed as
      Iphigenia. They led the first minuet before supper, and it was thought
      that they looked very fine. No one who has seen the two pictures of the
      scene, for which Zucchi was commissioned, can question this judgment. Lady
      Betty's portrait in one of these panels makes her even more beautiful than
      she appears on Sir Joshua's canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a display of fireworks of a detonating and discomposing type&mdash;the
      explosion, it was said, affected the nerves of nearly all the guests&mdash;and
      the illumination of the &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; already alluded to, this memorable
      fête came to no premature conclusion. Every one was bored to death by so
      much festivity coming all at once. The idea of twelve hours of masques and
      minuets is enough to make one's blood run cold. Its realisation may have
      had this effect upon the heroine of the day, hence the rumour that she
      found she had had enough of the Derby family to last her for the rest of
      her life without marrying the young heir. Unfortunately, however, if this
      was the case, she failed to justify the accuracy of the report; and she
      was married to Lord Stanley on the 23rd of the same month.
    </p>
    <p>
      The union of Maria Gunning with the Earl of Coventry was a miserable one,
      but this of her niece and Lord Stanley was infinitely worse. Lady Betty
      soon found out that she had made a mistake in marrying a man so incapable
      of appreciating her charm of manner as was Lord Stanley. The likelihood is
      that if she had married any other man she would have made the same
      discovery. The vivacity for which her mother apologised to Sir William
      Hamilton was, after her marriage, much more apparent than the
      thoughtfulness which the Duchess assured her correspondent was one of her
      daughter's traits. She showed herself to be appallingly vivacious upon
      more than one occasion. Just at that time there was a vivacious &ldquo;set&rdquo; in
      Lady Betty's world, and every member of it seemed striving for leadership.
      Few of the ladies knew exactly where the border line lay between vivacity
      and indiscretion. If Lady Betty was one of the better informed on this
      delicate question of delimitation, all that can be said is that she
      overstepped the line upon several occasions. It is not to be thought that
      her lightness ever bordered into actual vice, but it rarely fell short of
      being indiscreet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was always being talked about&mdash;always having curious escapades,
      none of them quite compromising, but all calculated to make the judicious
      grieve. But it is one thing to be subjected to the censure of the
      judicious and quite another to come before a judicial authority, and it is
      pretty certain that if Lady Derby&mdash;her husband succeeded to the title
      two years after his marriage&mdash;had incriminated herself, she would
      have been forced to defend a divorce suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, however, likewise certain that for some time she kept hovering like
      a butterfly about the portals of the Court, and a good deal of the bloom
      was blown off her wings by the breath of rumour. She had accepted the
      devotion of the Duke of Dorset, and, considering the number of eyes that
      were upon her and the devotion of His Grace, this was a very dangerous
      thing to do. They were constantly seen together and at all hours. This was
      in the second year of her marriage, but even in the first her desire to
      achieve notoriety by some means made itself apparent. But her escapade
      that was most talked about was really not worthy of the gossip of a Gower.
      She was at a ball at the house of Mrs. Onslow in St. James's Square, and
      her chair not arriving in good time to take her back to Grosvenor Square,
      it was suggested by Lord Lindsay and Mr. Storer that they should borrow
      Mrs. Onslow's chair and carry her between them to her home. She agreed to
      this gallant proposal, and off they set together. The young men bore her
      to her very door in spite of the fact that they had met her own chair soon
      after they had left Mrs. Onslow's porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was surely not much of an escapade in this transaction. The truth
      was probably that the chair did not arrive owing to the condition of the
      bearers, and when the young gentlemen met it they refused to jeopardise
      the safety of the lady by transferring her from Mrs. Onslow's chair to her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumour, however, was only too anxious to put the worst construction upon
      every act of the merry Countess, and it was doubtless because of this, and
      of her own knowledge of her daughter's thoughtlessness, that the Duchess
      of Argyll appeared upon the scene and endeavoured by her presence and
      advice to avert the catastrophe that seemed imminent. The Duchess insisted
      on accompanying her to every entertainment, and succeeded in keeping a
      watchful eye on her, though the Duke, who was at Inveraray, and was
      doubtless tired of hearing of the vivacity of his stepdaughter, wrote
      rather peremptorily for Her Grace to return to Scotland. She did not obey
      the summons, the fact being that she was devoted to this daughter of hers,
      who must have daily reminded her of her own sister Maria, to whom she had
      been so deeply attached. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It was said that she had refused the offer of the Duke of
     Bridgewater, because of his suggestion that she should break
     off all intercourse with Lady Coventry.
</pre>
    <p>
      Seeing, however, that she could not continue to look after this lively
      young matron, and being well aware of the fact that Lord Derby would never
      consent to live with her again, the Duchess could do no more than condone
      the separation which was inevitable. The deed was drawn up in 1779, five
      years after Lady Betty had been so inauspiciously bored by the <i>fête
      champêtre</i>.

    <p>
      In the meantime there was a good deal of talk about the Earl of Derby
      himself. A young nobleman who takes a lively, or even a grave, interest in
      the personnel of the theatre is occasionally made the subject of vulgar
      gossip. Lord Derby had a reputation as an amateur actor, and he seemed to
      think that it would be increased by association with professional
      actresses. It is doubtful if he was justified in his views on this
      delicate question. At any rate, rightly or wrongly, on his estrangement
      from his wife, but two years before the final separation, he showed a
      greater devotion than ever to dramatic performances and dramatic
      performers. His uncle by marriage, now General Burgoyne, had written a
      play that turned out an extraordinary success. This was <i>The Heiress</i>,
      and it had received extravagant praise in many influential quarters. It
      was while it was still being talked of in society that a company of
      distinguished amateurs undertook to produce it at Richmond House, in
      Whitehall Place. In order that the representation might be as perfect as
      possible, the Duchess of Richmond engaged the actress who had taken the
      chief part in the original production, to superintend the rehearsals of
      her amateurs. Miss Farren was a young person of considerable beauty, and
      more even than an actress's share of discretion. She was in George
      Colman's company at the Haymarket, and was rapidly taking the place of
      Mrs. Abington in the affections of playgoers. She was the daughter of a
      surgeon in a small way&mdash;he may have been one of the barber surgeons
      of the eighteenth century. Marrying an actress (also in a small way), he
      adopted the stage as a profession, and became a strolling actor-manager,
      whenever he got the chance, and died before his drinking habits had quite
      demoralised his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farren was a wise woman&mdash;wise enough to know that she was a bad
      actress, but that there were possibilities in her two daughters. It was
      after only a brief season of probation that Colman engaged one of the
      girls to do small parts, promoting her in an emergency to be a
      &ldquo;principal.&rdquo; Miss Farren proved herself capable of making the most of her
      opportunity, and the result was that within a year she was taking Mrs.
      Abington's parts in the best comedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother was sensible enough to perceive that there was room in the best
      society for an actress of ability as well as respectability&mdash;up to
      that time the two qualities had seldom been found associated&mdash;and
      Mrs. Farren was right. No whisper had ever been heard against the young
      lady, and a judicious introduction or two brought her into many
      drawing-rooms of those leaders of society who were also respectable, and
      this was of advantage to her not only socially, but professionally. Horace
      Walpole was able to write of her: &ldquo;In distinction of manner and refinement
      she excelled Mrs. Abington, who could never go beyond Lady Teazle, which
      is a second-rate character.&rdquo; Again, in a letter to Lady Ossory, he
      ascribed the ability of Miss Farren to the fact that she was accustomed to
      mingle with the best society.
    </p>
    <p>
      This theory of Walpole's has been frequently controverted since his day,
      and now no one will venture to assert that there is really anything in it,
      although it sounds plausible enough. Miss Farren had, however, ample
      opportunity of studying &ldquo;the real thing&rdquo; and of profiting by her study.
      She found herself on the most intimate footing with duchesses&mdash;not of
      the baser sort like her of Ancaster, or of the eccentric sort like her of
      Bedford, but of the most exalted. The Duchess of Richmond and the Duchess
      of Leinster were among her friends, and thus it was that her appearance at
      the rehearsals of <i>The Heiress</i> of Whitehall Place was not wholly
      professional. Upon this occasion she met Lord Derby and also Charles James
      Fox, the latter having accepted the rather onerous duties of stage
      manager. Before any of the performers were letter perfect in their
      dialogue, Miss Farren had captured the hearts of both these men. Having
      some of the qualities necessary to success as a statesman, including
      caution and an instinct as to the right moment to retire from a contest
      that must end in some one being made a fool of, Mr. Fox soon withdrew from
      a position of rivalry with Lord Derby. It was rumoured by the malicious,
      who had at heart the maintenance of the good name of Miss Farren, that Mr.
      Fox had been dismissed by the lady with great indignation on his making a
      proposition to her that did not quite meet her views in regard to the
      ceremony of marriage. Miss Farren they asserted to be a paragon of virtue,
      and so she undoubtedly was. Her virtue was of the most ostentatious type.
      She would never admit a gentleman to an audience unless some witness of
      her virtue was present. She accepted the devotion of Lord Derby, but gave
      him to understand quite plainly that so long as his wife was alive she
      could only agree to be his <i>fiancée</i>. Truly a very dragon of virtue
      was Miss Farren!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl, previous to his meeting the actress, had been a dutiful if not a
      very devoted husband. But as soon as he fell in love with this paragon of
      virtue he became careless, and made no attempt to restrain his wife in her
      thoughtless behaviour. He allowed her to go her own way, and he went his
      way. His way led him almost every evening to the green room at the
      Haymarket and Drury Lane, where Miss Farren was to be found. The
      estrangement between himself and his wife that resulted in the final
      separation was the result not of his infatuation for the actress, but of
      her virtuous acceptance of him as her moral lover. She took care never to
      compromise herself with him or any one else, but she did not mind taking
      the man away from his wife and home in order that she might be accredited
      with occupying an absolutely unique position in the annals of the English
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Miss Farren had been a little less virtuous and a little more human she
      would run a better chance of obtaining the sympathy of such people as are
      capable of differentiating between a woman's virtue and the virtues of
      womankind. She seemed to think that the sole duty of a woman is to be
      discreet in regard to herself&mdash;to give no one a chance of pointings
      finger of scorn at her; and it really seemed as if this was also the creed
      of the noble people with whom she associated. Every one seemed to be so
      paralysed by her propriety as to be incapable of perceiving how
      contemptible a part she was playing. An honest woman, with the instincts
      of goodness and with some sense of her duty, would, the moment a married
      man offers her his devotion, send him pretty quickly about his business.
      The most elementary sense of duty must suggest the adoption of such a
      course of treatment in regard to an illicit admirer. But Miss Farren had
      no such sense. She met the philandering of her lover with smiles and a
      virtuous handshake. She accepted his offer of an adoring friendship for
      the present with a reversion of the position of Countess of Derby on the
      death of the existing holder of the title and its appurtenances; and
      people held her up, and continue to hold her up, as an example of all that
      is virtuous and amiable in life!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was also commended for her patience, as Lord Derby was for his
      constancy. They had both great need of these qualities, for the unhappy
      barrier to their union showed no signs of getting out of their way, either
      by death or divorce. She became strangely discreet, taking, in fact, a
      leaf out of Miss Farren's book of deportment, and never giving her husband
      a chance of freeing himself from the tie that bound him nominally to her.
      It must have been very gratifying to the actress to perceive how effective
      was the example she set to the Countess in regard to the adherence to the
      path of rectitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the exact impression produced upon Lord Derby by all this decorum
      it would be difficult to say. He may have been pleased to discover that he
      was married to a lady to whom his honour was more precious than he had any
      reason or any right to believe it to be. But assuredly a less placid
      gentleman would have found himself wishing now and again that&mdash;well,
      that matters had arranged themselves differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years went by without bringing about a more satisfactory <i>modus
      vivendi</i> than was in existence when Lord Derby originally offered his
      heart and hand (the latter when it should become vacant) to the actress.
      Lady Derby was in wretched health, but still showed no more inclination to
      die than does a chronic invalid. Miss Farren continued to drive her
      splendid chariot, with its coachmen on the hammer-cloth and its footmen
      clinging on to the straps behind, down to the stage-door of the theatre,
      and to fill the house every night that she played. Her popularity seemed
      to grow with years, and she appeared in a wide range of characters, making
      her audiences accept as correct her reading of every part, though the best
      critics&mdash;Walpole was about the worst&mdash;of her art had a good deal
      to say that was not quite favourable to her style. Only once, however, did
      she make a flagrant error on the stage, and this was when she was
      misguided enough to put on men's garments in representing the part of
      Tracy Lovell in Colman's play, <i>The Suicide</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this unhappy exhibition which she made of herself she disillusioned
      those of her admirers who fancied that she was a model of grace from the
      sole of her feet to the crown of her head. She never repeated this
      performance. Had she done so in Lord Derby's presence, his constancy would
      have been put to a severer test than any to which he had been previously
      subjected. The best judges of what constitutes grace in a woman were
      unanimous in their advice to the lady never to forsake the friendly
      habiliments which she was accustomed to wear, and never to allow her
      emulation of the perpetually chaste goddess to lead her to adopt even for
      an hour the convenient garb in which she went a-hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while his fiancée was moving from triumph to triumph, putting every
      other actress in the shade, the Earl of Derby was putting on flesh. But as
      his flesh became more visible so did his faith. He was a model of
      fidelity. His name was never associated with the name of any other lady&mdash;not
      even that of his wife&mdash;during his long years of probation, and twenty
      years form a rather protracted period for a man to wait in order to marry
      an actress. It was not to be wondered if the spectacle of the devoted
      young peer waiting for the beautiful girl in the green room, which was
      allowed to the habitués of that fascinating apartment during the earlier
      years of this strange attachment, produced quite a different effect upon
      people from that which was the result of witnessing a somewhat obese,
      elderly gentleman panting along by the side of a chaste lady of forty. Nor
      was it remarkable that, on seeing one day by the side of Miss Farren, a
      gallant young man whose walk and bearing suggested to elderly spectators a
      rejuvenated Lord Stanley, they should rub their eyes and ask what miracle
      was this that time and true love had wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only miracle that time had wrought was to make the son of the Earl of
      Derby twenty-one years of age and rather interested in the personnel of
      green rooms. He had been introduced to Miss Farren by his father; but to
      his honour be it said, he made no attempt to take his father's place in
      regard to the lady, except as her escort to her house in Green Street. The
      gossip that suggested such a possibility was just what one might expect to
      find in one of Walpole's letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the shameful, if virtuous, devotion of twenty years was rewarded
      by the announcement of the death of the wretched Countess whose desertion
      dated from the day her husband met the actress. Miss Farren, with that
      extraordinary bad taste which characterised every period of her intimacy
      with Lord Derby, took an ostentatious farewell of the stage, and proved by
      the faltering of her voice, her emotion, and her final outburst in tears,
      that time had not diminished from the arts of her art. Of course, there
      was a scene of intense emotion in the theatre, which was increased when
      King led her forward and Wroughton spoke a rhymed and stagey farewell in
      her presence. Four of its lines were these:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But ah! this night adieu the joyous mien,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When Mirth's lov'd fav'rite quits the mimic scene,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Startled Thalia would th'assent refuse,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But Truth and Virtue sued and won the Muse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth and Virtue&mdash;these were the patrons of the compact by which Miss
      Farren waited for twenty years for the death of the wife of the man whom
      she had promised to marry&mdash;when she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene in the green room when the actress came off the stage was an
      unqualified success. Tears flowed freely, making channels as they
      meandered down the paint; sobs came from the actresses who hoped to get a
      chance of doing some of her parts now that she had left the stage; and
      Miss Farren herself showed that she knew what were the elements of a
      proper climax, by fainting with a shriek, in the midst of which she made
      an exit supported by all the actors who were not already supporting some
      of the hysterical ladies in the background. They all deserved to have
      their salaries raised. The whole scene was a triumph&mdash;of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact chronology of the crisis is worth noting. Lady Derby died on
      March 4th, and was buried on April 2nd. On April 8th Miss Farren took her
      farewell of the stage, and on May 1st she was married to the Earl of
      Derby. A satisfactory explanation of the indecent delay in the celebration
      of the marriage was forthcoming: his lordship had been suffering from an
      attack of gout.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if no one ventured to cast an aspersion upon his character or to
      accuse him of shilly-shallying in regard to the postponement of his
      nuptials until his wife had been nearly a whole month in her grave, there
      was a good deal of funny gossip set loose when, after a honeymoon of two
      days, the Earl and the Countess returned to London. This also was
      satisfactorily explained: the Countess was devoted to her mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage proved a very happy one, and thirty-two years passed before
      the Countess died. Her husband survived her by five years. He died in
      1834, fifty-seven years after his first meeting with the actress, and
      forty-seven since he instituted &ldquo;The Derby&rdquo; race meeting, winning the
      first cup by his horse Sir Peter Teazle.

    <h2>
      THE PLOT OF A LADY NOVELIST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the year 1790-1
      there was played in real life a singularly poor adaptation of an unwritten
      novel by one of the Minifie sisters&mdash;those sentimental ladies who,
      during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, provided the
      circulating libraries with several volumes of high-flown fiction. The
      adaptation of this unwritten novel possessed a good many of the most
      prominent features of the original, so that when it was brought to light
      there could be very little doubt as to the brain out of which it had been
      evolved. The result of the performance was so unsatisfactory as to compel
      one to believe that the worst possible way of producing a novel is to
      adapt it to suit the requirements of one's relations, forcing them to play
      in real life and in all earnest the parts assigned to them by the inventor
      of the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Minifie, the second of the sentimental sisters, had married in the
      year 1769 Colonel John Gunning, the brother of the two beautiful girls one
      of whom became Duchess of Hamilton, and later Duchess of Argyll, and the
      other Countess of Coventry. The result of the union was a daughter of
      considerable plainness, and people said that in this respect she resembled
      her mother's rather than her father's family. It seems that while the
      Gunning tradition was beauty, the Minifie tradition was a nose, and it
      soon became apparent that it was impossible to combine the two with any
      satisfactory artistic results. The young lady had made an honest attempt
      to do so, but her failure was emphatic. She had eyes that suggested in a
      far-off way the long-lashed orbs of her aunts, but that unlucky Minifie
      nose was so prominent a feature that it caused the attention of even the
      most indulgent critic to be riveted upon it, to the exclusion of the rest
      of her face. The charitably-disposed among her friends affirmed that she
      would be passably good-looking if it were not for her nose; the others
      said that she would be positively plain if it were not for her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father was probably that member of his family who had least brains:
      they made a soldier of him, and he married a lady novelist, closing an
      inglorious career by running off with his tailor's wife and having a writ
      issued against him for £5000. He took care to be at Naples, outside the
      jurisdiction of the English court, when it was issued, and he died before
      it could be served on him, which suggests that he may not have been so
      devoid of brains after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother (<i>née</i> Minifie) seems to have entertained the idea of
      making the girl work out a &ldquo;plot&rdquo; for her when she arrived at the
      regulation age of the sentimental heroine of those days, and this plot she
      invented with all her accustomed absence of skill. Her materials were a
      &ldquo;glorious child&rdquo;&mdash;this was how she described her daughter&mdash;with
      a gifted mother; a young cousin, heir to a dukedom and a large estate;
      and, lastly, the Gunning tradition. Could any novelist ask for more? A
      short time afterwards she did, however, and this was just where her art
      failed her. She did much to discourage the writers of fiction from
      endeavouring to work out their plots in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine Gunning, the &ldquo;glorious child,&rdquo; being the niece of the Duchess of
      Argyll, her cousin was, of course, the Marquis of Lome; and as the Duchess
      had always kept up an intimate connection with the members of her father's
      family, even to the second generation, her son, Lord Lome, and Catherine
      Gunning had been a good deal together, not only when they were children,
      but also when they had reached the age when the novel-writer's hero and
      heroine begin to blossom. The girl's mother, doubtless having an idea that
      these very live young people were as plastic as the creatures of her
      fancy, thought to hasten on the <i>dénouement</i> of her story by
      whispering it to her friends. She whispered into more than one ear that
      Lord Lome and her daughter were betrothed, and such friends as received
      this information, strictly <i>sub rosa</i>, took care to spread it abroad&mdash;strictly
      <i>sub rosa</i> also. Now the aggregation of many confidential reports of
      this sort is what is termed &ldquo;news,&rdquo; so that in the course of a short time
      it was common property that Lord Lome was to marry his cousin, Catherine
      Gunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congratulations reached the young lady, which she neither quite accepted
      nor altogether rejected. She seems to have learned from her mother's
      novels that in such matters it is wisest for a young woman to be silent
      but pensive. And on the whole her behaviour was fairly consistent with
      that of the heroine which her mother meant her to be. Indeed, all that was
      needed to enable her to take the place of the heroine of a pleasant little
      love story was the proposal of the hero; and unhappily this formality had
      still to be reckoned with. Lord Lome had so paltry an appreciation of what
      was due to the art of the fiction-writer that he declined to play the part
      of the young hero of the story, and when people approached him on the
      subject he said that he had heard nothing about being accepted by Miss
      Gunning, and that he could not possibly be accepted until he had proposed
      to her. He seems to have acted with the discretion one would have looked
      for from the son of the Duchess of Argyll, and in the course of the year
      the reports of the possible union dwindled away, and people began to feel
      that their friends were untrustworthy gossips to have circulated a report
      solely on the evidence of a young lady's pensiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was, however, as it turned out, but the opening chapter in the
      romance which the novelist-mother was working out. Indeed, it scarcely
      bears to be considered as a regular chapter, it was rather the prologue to
      the comedy which was played two years later with the same heroine, but for
      obvious reasons with a different hero. In the prologue there was scarcely
      visible any of the art of the novelist; in the comedy itself, however, her
      hand is constantly apparent, controlling the movements of at least one of
      her puppets; and very jerkily, too, that hand pulled the strings. The
      clumsiness in the construction of the plot prevented any one from
      sympathising with the authoress and stage-manager of the piece when its
      failure became known to the world in general, and to Horace Walpole in
      particular. Walpole could pretend a good deal. He pretended, for instance,
      that he knew at once that the Rowley poems, sent to him by Chatterton,
      were forgeries; and he pretended that he knew nothing of the marriage of
      his niece to the Duke of Gloucester until the public were apprised of the
      fact. He could not, however, even pretend that he sympathised with the
      failure of the Minifie plot. On the contrary, he gloats over the disgrace
      which, he declared, on this account fell upon the Gunning family. He hated
      the whole Gunning family, and he was plainly in ecstasies of delight when
      he believed that ruin had come upon them. &ldquo;The two beautiful sisters were
      exalted almost as high as they could go,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Countessed and double
      duchessed, and now the family have dragged themselves down into the very
      dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;family&rdquo; had of course done nothing of the sort. One member of the
      family had allowed herself to be made a fool of at the suggestion of her
      very foolish mother; her father had also been indiscreet, but there is a
      wide difference between all this and the family of Gunning &ldquo;dragging
      themselves into the very dirt.&rdquo; The result of the tricks of the lady
      novelist to marry her daughter to the heir to a dukedom was only to make
      every one roar with laughter, and no doubt the fatuous ladies felt greatly
      annoyed. But the Marquis of Lome did not seem to take the matter greatly
      to heart, and he was a member of the Gunning family; nor did the Duke of
      Hamilton show himself to be greatly perturbed, though he must have been
      somewhat jealous of the honour of the family to which his mother belonged.
      The position that the Gunning family had taken among the greatest families
      in the land rested upon too solid a foundation to be shaken by the
      foolishness of a lady novelist, who had married a Gunning. And now people
      who read the story of the &ldquo;dragging in the dirt&rdquo; only shrug their
      shoulders at the ridiculous figure cut by the actors in the shallow and
      sordid comedy, and laugh at the spiteful gibe of the prince of gossips,
      who played a congenial part in damning the product of the Minifie brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years after the failure of the Lome plot startling whispers were once
      again heard in regard to Miss Gunning and the heir to another dukedom.
      This time it was the Marquis of Blandford who attracted the Minifie fancy.
      He was the Duke of Marlborough's heir, and was twenty-three years of age.
      Of course it was Mrs. Gunning (<i>née</i> Minifie) who was the first to
      make the announcement that the young people were greatly attached; and
      then followed&mdash;after the interval of a chapter or two&mdash;the lady
      novelist's declaration to her niece, a Mrs. Bowen, that Lord Blandford had
      proposed, and had been accepted by Miss Gunning. The date of the marriage
      had been fixed, and the draft deed of the settlements signed; but, as in
      the former &ldquo;case,&rdquo; the recipient of the news was told that she must regard
      the communication as strictly confidential, the fact being that although
      the arrangements for the match were so fully matured, yet General Gunning&mdash;he
      had recently been made a general&mdash;had not been let into the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have seemed a little queer to Mrs. Bowen to learn that her uncle
      had not been made acquainted with the good luck that was in store for his
      daughter. The signing of marriage deeds in the absence of the bride's
      father must surely have struck her as being a trifle irregular. However
      this may be, she seems to have treated the communication as strictly
      confidential by at once proceeding to spread abroad the news that it
      contained. It reached the ears of several people of distinction before
      long. General Conway heard of it, and from a quarter that seemed to him
      absolutely trustworthy. He passed it round to Walpole and the Court
      circle. The Duke of Argyll, as the uncle of the young lady most interested
      in the match, was apprised of it in due course, and on appealing to
      headquarters&mdash;that is to say, to Mrs. Gunning&mdash;for confirmation
      or denial of the report, learned that the marriage had indeed been
      &ldquo;arranged,&rdquo; but the question of settlements remained in abeyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards there came rumours that there were obstacles in the way
      of the marriage, and Miss Gunning, on being questioned by some of her
      friends, confessed that it was the parents of her lover who were unkind:
      young Lord Blandford was burning with anxiety to call her his own, but the
      Duke and Duchess belonged unfortunately to that type of parent to be found
      in so many novels in which the course of true love runs anything but
      smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, it was just at this point that a letter appeared in the <i>Advertiser</i>,
      signed by General Gunning, apprising the world of the fact that the
      Gunnings were one of the noblest families in existence, the writer
      actually being able to trace his ancestry up to Charlemagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while people were so laughing over this letter as to cause him to
      declare it to be a forgery, that the General became suspicious of the
      genuineness of his daughter's statements in regard to her <i>affaire de
      cour</i>. When a blunt old soldier finds a letter bearing his signature in
      the papers, well knowing that he never wrote such a letter, he is apt to
      question the good faith even of his nearest and dearest. It is certain, at
      any rate, that the descendant of Charlemagne had an uneasy feeling that
      any woman who wrote novels was not to be implicitly trusted in the affairs
      of daily life. His mind running on forged letters, he commanded his
      daughter to submit to him her correspondence with her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gunning at once complied, and he sat down to read the lot. The result
      was not to allay his suspicions. The letters read remarkably well, and
      contained the conventional outpourings of an ardent lover to the object of
      his affections. But to the simple soldier's mind they read just too well:
      some of them were in the style of a novel-writer with whom he was
      acquainted&mdash;imperfectly, it would appear, or he would have suspected
      something long before. Retaining the precious &ldquo;pacquet&rdquo; he awaited
      developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not long to wait. Another contribution to the correspondence which
      he had in his hand came to his daughter, and was passed on to him.
      Noticing in it some doubtful features, he came to the conclusion that it
      was necessary to get to the bottom of the affair in the most
      straightforward way. He leapt to the bottom of it by sending the whole
      &ldquo;pacquet&rdquo; to the young Marquis of Blandford, asking him peremptorily if he
      had written the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got a reply to the effect that a few of the letters were his&mdash;they
      were the ordinary ones, courteous, but in no way effusive&mdash;but that
      the greater number had not come from him. His lordship did not seem to
      think that common politeness demanded his expressing his hearty
      concurrence with the tone and sentiments contained in these same letters.
      Now in the judgment of a novelist of the intellectual calibre of the
      Minifie sisters this is exactly what a young gentleman would do when
      playing the part of the hero of a romance, so that it would appear that
      General Gunning was fully justified in coming to the conclusion that the
      whole scheme&mdash;the whole piece of scheming&mdash;was the design of his
      wife&mdash;that it represented an attempt on her part to force one of her
      &ldquo;plots&rdquo; upon some real personages. Dull-minded man though he certainly
      was, he must have perceived that his wife's plan was to compel Lord
      Blandford to act the part of the hero of her sentimental imagination, and
      when confronted with a parcel of forged letters, in every one of which
      there was a confession of love for Miss Gunning, to bow his head meekly,
      as any gentleman (of her imagination) would, and say, &ldquo;Those are my
      letters, and they express nothing but the most honourable sentiments of my
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as it so happened the young Lord Blandford was not a young gentleman
      of this particular stamp. He seems to have been almost as practical as his
      great ancestor, who, out of the proceeds of his first love intrigue,
      bought an annuity for himself. Hence the fiasco of the Minifie plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Minifie plot, however, was not worked out in one act only, and an
      insignificant prologue. The resources of the lady's imagination were by no
      means exhausted by the failure of Lord Blandford to act up to the heroic
      part assigned to him. He seems to have talked a good deal to his friends
      about the forged letters, and the Duke of Argyll, the young lady's uncle,
      took the matter up as an important member by marriage of the family. He
      applied to his niece for an explanation of the whole affair; and her
      father seems to have agreed with him in thinking that if the girl was ever
      to hold up her head again it would be necessary for her to bring forward
      some evidence to prove what she still asserted, namely, that the letters
      had been written to her by Lord Blandford&mdash;this &ldquo;pacquet&rdquo; of letters
      played as important a part in the story of Miss Gunning as the &ldquo;Casquet
      Letters&rdquo; did in the history of Queen Mary&mdash;and that they were written
      with the concurrence and approbation of the Duke and Duchess of
      Marlborough. The Duke and Duchess had, she affirmed, encouraged her by the
      most unmistakable means to believe that they were extremely anxious to see
      her married to their son.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then suggested&mdash;Horace Walpole, who gloats over the whole
      story in a letter to one of the Berrys, does not say by whom&mdash;that
      the young woman should draw up a narrative of the progress of the
      attachment professed for her by Lord Blandford, and of the particular acts
      of encouragement for which she alleged the Duke and Duchess were
      responsible, leading her to feel sure that she was a <i>persona grata</i>
      with them. It was hoped by the Duke of Argyll and General Gunning that the
      girl would be rehabilitated in the eyes of society by the production of
      the Duke of Marlborough's formal assent to the statements made by Miss
      Gunning in endeavouring to exculpate herself. Miss Gunning assenting&mdash;after
      a consultation with her mother, we may be sure&mdash;a &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; was
      accordingly prepared by the young lady, and in it there was the ingenuous
      confession that although she had been unable to resist so dazzling an
      offer as that of Lord Blandford, she had not wavered in her affection for
      her cousin, the Marquis of Lome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have the true Minifie touch of sentimentality, and we cannot doubt
      that the remaining portion of the plot was due to her clumsy ingenuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This narrative was sent to the Duke of Marlborough, with the following
      letter from General Gunning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. James's Place,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>3 rd February</i>, 1791.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord,&mdash;I have the honour of addressing this letter to your Grace
      not with the smallest wish after what has passed of having a marriage
      established between Lord Blandford and my daughter, or of claiming any
      promise or proposal to that effect, but merely to know whether your Grace
      or the Duchess of Marlborough have it in recollection that your Graces or
      Lord Blandford ever gave my daughter reason to think a marriage was once
      intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My motive for giving this trouble arises merely from a desire of removing
      any imputation from my daughter's character, as if she had entertained an
      idea of such importance without any reasonable foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own satisfaction, and that of my particular friends who have been
      induced to believe the reports of the intended marriage, I have desired my
      daughter to draw up an accurate narrative of every material circumstance
      on which that belief was founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This narrative I have the honour of transmitting to your Grace for your
      own perusal, and that of the Duchess of Marlborough and Lord Blandford,
      thinking it highly suitable that you should have an early opportunity of
      examining it&mdash;and I beg leave to request that your Grace will, after
      examination, correct or alter such passages as may appear either to your
      Grace, the Duchess of Marlborough, or Lord Blandford, to be erroneously
      stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honour to be,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the greatest respect, my Lord,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Grace's most humble and
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Gunning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter was dispatched by a groom to its destination at Blenheim, and
      within half an hour of his delivering it, His Grace, according to the
      groom, had handed him a reply for General Gunning. This document, which
      the groom said he had received from the Duke, was forwarded, with a copy
      of the letter to which it constituted a most satisfactory reply, to a
      small and very select committee that had, it would seem, been appointed to
      investigate and report upon the whole story. It must also be quoted in
      full, in order that its point may be fully appreciated by any one
      interested in this very remarkable story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;I take the earliest opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of
      your letter, and to answer it with that explicitness you are so much
      entitled to. From the first of the acquaintance of the D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s
      of Marlborough and myself had with Miss Gunning, we were charmed with her,
      and it was with infinite satisfaction we discovered <i>Blanford's</i>
      sentiments similar to our own. It had long been the wish of both to see
      him married to some amiable woman. Your daughter was the one we had fixed
      on, and we had every reason to suppose the object of his tenderest
      affections, and, from the conduct of both himself and his family, yourself
      and Miss Gunning had undoubtedly every right to look on a marriage as
      certain. Indeed when I left town last summer, I regarded her as my future
      daughter, and I must say it is with sorrow I relinquish the idea. The
      actions of young men are not always to be accounted for; and it is with
      regret that I acknowledge my son has been particularly unaccountable in
      his. I beg that you will do me the justice to believe that I shall ever
      think myself your debtor for the manner in which you have conducted
      yourself in this affair, and that I must always take an interest in the
      happiness of Miss Gunning. I beg, if she has not conceived a disgust for
      the whole of my family, she will accept the sincerest good wishes of the
      Duchess and my daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honour to remain,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your much obliged and
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most obedient, humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marlborough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now be it remembered that both these letters were forwarded to the
      committee with the young lady's narrative, to be considered by them in the
      same connection, at Argyll House, where their sittings were to be held.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be said in the face of such documentary evidence as this?
      Those members of the committee who hoped that the girl's statement of her
      case would be in some measure borne out by the Duke of Marlborough could
      never have hoped for so triumphant a confirmation of her story as was
      contained in His Grace's letter. It seemed as if the investigation of the
      committee would be of the simplest character; handing them such a letter,
      accompanying her own ingenuous narrative, it was felt that she had
      completely vindicated her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly one member of the committee&mdash;Walpole in the letter to
      Miss Berry affirms that he was this one&mdash;ventured to point out that
      in the Duke's letter the name <i>Blandford</i> was spelt without the
      middle letter <i>d</i>. &ldquo;That was possible in the hurry of doing justice,&rdquo;
       wrote Walpole. But the moment that this pin-puncture of suspicion appeared
      in the fabric of the lady's defence it was not thought any sacrilege to
      try to pick another hole in it. The wax with which the letter was sealed
      was black, and the members of the council asked one another whom the
      Marlborough family were in mourning for, that they should seal their
      letter in this fashion. No information on this point was forthcoming. (It
      is strange if Walpole did not suggest that they were in mourning over the
      defunct reputation of the young lady.) If the Duke of Argyll was present,
      it can well be believed that, after the members of the council had looked
      at each other, there should be silence in that room, on one wall of which
      we may believe there was hanging the splendid portrait of Elizabeth,
      Duchess of Argyll and Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon, in her own right,
      painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The lady was dying at her Scotch home when
      this investigation into the conduct of her niece was being conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably a relief to every one present when the suggestion was made
      that the Duke of Marlborough's second son was in town, and if sent for he
      might be able to throw some light upon the subject of the mourning wax or
      some other questionable point in the same connection. Although it was now
      close upon midnight a messenger was dispatched for the young man&mdash;probably
      his whereabouts at midnight would be known with greater certainty than at
      midday. At any rate he was quickly found, and repaired in all haste to
      Argyll House. He was brought before the committee and shown the letter
      with the black wax. He burst out laughing, and declared that the writing
      bore not the least resemblance to that of his father, the Duke of
      Marlborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more to be said. The council adjourned <i>sine die</i>
      without drawing up any report, so far as can be ascertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the full clumsiness of the Minifie &ldquo;plot&rdquo; was revealed the next day,
      for General Gunning received a letter from the Captain Bowen whose name
      has already entered into this narrative, telling him that his wife, the
      General's niece, had a short time before received from Miss Gunning a
      letter purporting to be a copy of one which had come to her from the Duke
      of Marlborough, and begging her to get her husband to make a fair copy of
      it, and return it by the groom. Captain Bowen added that he had complied
      with his wife's request to this effect, but he had written &ldquo;<i>copy</i>&rdquo;
       at the top and &ldquo;<i>signed M</i>.&rdquo; at the bottom, as is usual in engrossing
      copies of documents, to prevent the possibility of a charge of forgery
      being brought against the copyist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter which the girl wrote to Mrs. Bowen was made the subject of an
      affidavit shortly afterwards, and so became public property. It is so
      badly composed that one cannot but believe it was dictated by her mother,
      though the marvellous spelling must have been Miss Gunning's own. The fact
      that, after making up a story of her love for Lord Lome, and of the
      encouragement she received from the Marlborough family in respect of Lord
      Blandford, she instructed Mrs. Bowen to keep the matter secret from her
      mother, confirms one's impression as to the part the lady must have played
      in the transaction. Miss Gunning wrote: &ldquo;Neither papa or I have courage to
      tell mama, for she detests the person dearest to me on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But however deficient in courage her papa was in the matter of acquainting
      his wife with so ordinary an incident as was referred to in this letter,
      he did not shrink from what he believed to be his duty when it was made
      plain to him that his daughter and his wife had been working out a &ldquo;plot&rdquo;
       in real life that necessitated the forging of a letter. He promptly
      bundled both wife and daughter out of his house, doubtless feeling that
      although the other personages in the romance which his wife was hoping to
      weave, had by no means acted up to the parts she had meant them to play,
      there was no reason why he should follow their example. It must be
      acknowledged that as a type of the bluff old soldier, simple enough to be
      deceived by the inartistic machinations of a foolish wife, but inexorable
      when finding his credulity imposed upon, he played his part extremely
      well. At the same time such people as called him a ridiculous old fool for
      adopting so harsh a measure toward his erring child, whose tricks he had
      long winked at, were perhaps not to be greatly blamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Duchess of Bedford at once received the outcasts and provided them
      with a home; and then Mrs. Gunning had leisure to concoct a manifesto in
      form of an open letter to the Duke of Argyll, in which, after exhorting
      His Grace to devote the remainder of his life to unravelling the mystery
      which she affirmed (though no one else could have done so) enshrouded the
      whole affair of the letter, she went on to denounce the simple-hearted
      General for his meanness&mdash;and worse&mdash;in matters domestic. He had
      never been a true husband to her, she declared, and he was even more
      unnatural as a father. As for Captain Bowen and his wife, the writer of
      the manifesto showed herself to be upon the brink of delirium when she
      endeavoured to find words severe enough to describe their treachery. They
      were inhuman in their persecution of her &ldquo;glorious child,&rdquo; she said, and
      then she went on to affirm her belief that the incriminating letters had
      been forged by the Bowens, and the rest of the story invented by them with
      the aid of the General to ruin her and her &ldquo;glorious child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bowen thought fit to reply to this amazing production. He did so
      through the prosaic form of a number of affidavits. The most important of
      these was that sworn by one William Pearce, groom to General Gunning. In
      this document he deposed that when he was about to start for Blenheim with
      the &ldquo;pacquet&rdquo; for the Duke of Marlborough, Miss Gunning had caught him and
      compelled him to hand over the &ldquo;pacquet&rdquo; to her, and that she had then
      given him another letter, sealed with black, bearing the Marlborough arms,
      instructing him to deliver it to her father, pretending that he had
      received it at Blenheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all this Miss Gunning continued to affirm her entire
      innocence, and even went the length&mdash;according to Walpole&mdash;of
      swearing before a London magistrate that she was innocent. &ldquo;It is but a
      burlesque part of this wonderful tale,&rdquo; adds Walpole, &ldquo;that old crazy
      Bedford exhibits Miss every morning on the Causeway in Hyde Park and
      declares her <i>protégée</i> some time ago refused General Trevelyan.&rdquo; But
      &ldquo;crazy old Bedford&rdquo; went much further in her craziness than this, for she
      actually wrote to the Marquis of Lome trying to patch up a match between
      Miss Gunning and himself. Immediately afterwards the town was startled by
      the report that a duel was impending between Lord Lome and Lord Blandford,
      the former maintaining that it was his duty to uphold the honour of his
      cousin, which had been somewhat shaken by the course adopted by the
      Marlborough heir. Of course no duel took place, and the young men simply
      laughed when their attention was called to the statement in print.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much further these alarums and excursions (on the Causeway) would have
      proceeded it would be impossible to tell, the fact being that Captain
      Bowen and his wife gave notice of their intention to institute proceedings
      against the Gunnings, mother and daughter, for libel. This brought <i>l'affaire
      Gunning</i> to a legitimate conclusion, for the ladies thought it
      advisable to fly to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The town is very dull without them,&rdquo; wrote Walpole to one of the Berrys,
      enclosing a copy of a really clever skit in verse, after the style of &ldquo;The
      House that Jack Built,&rdquo; ridiculing the whole affair. When Mrs. Gunning and
      her daughter returned, after the lapse of several months, the old Duchess
      of Bedford took them up once more; but the town declined to take any
      further notice of them. It was not until her father and mother had been
      dead for some years that Miss Gunning married Major Plunkett, an Irish
      rebel, who fled after the rising in 1798. She lived with him happily
      enough for twenty years, endeavouring to atone for the indiscretion of her
      girlhood by writing novels. It is doubtful if many of her readers
      considered such expiation wholly adequate, considering how foolish she had
      been. One act of folly can hardly be atoned for by another. But her
      intention was good, and her faults, including her novels, have long ago
      been forgiven her by being forgotten.

    <h2>
      TRAGEDY WITH A TWINKLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the summer of
      1770 there arrived at the town of Lisle a coach containing three ladies
      and one man, followed by a travelling chaise with servants and luggage. Of
      the ladies, one was approaching middle age, handsome and elegant; the
      other two were her daughters, and both were extremely beautiful and
      graceful girls, under twenty years of age. The man was a small,
      middle-aged person, with a face which one would have called plain if it
      had not been that the protruding of his upper lip and the twinkle in his
      eyes suggested not plainness, but comedy. The very soul of comedy was in
      the gravity of his face; but it was that sort which is not apparent to all
      the world. It was the soul of comedy, not the material part; and most
      people are disposed to deny the possibility of comedy's existing except in
      juxtaposition with the grin through the horse-collar. Solemnity in a face,
      with a twinkle in the eye&mdash;that is an expression which comedy may
      wear without arousing the curiosity&mdash;certainly without exciting the
      laughter&mdash;of the multitude. And this was exactly the form that the
      drama of this man's life assumed; only it was tragedy with a twinkle.
      Tragedy with a twinkle&mdash;that was Oliver Goldsmith.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      The vehicles drew up in the courtyard of the hotel in the square, and Dr.
      Goldsmith, after dismounting and helping the ladies to dismount, gave
      orders in French to the landlord in respect of the luggage, and made
      inquiries as to the table d'hôte. Shown to their respective rooms, the
      members of the party did not meet again for some time, and then it was in
      the private <i>salle</i> which they had engaged, looking out upon the
      square. The two girls were seated at a window, and their mother was
      writing letters at a table at one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Goldsmith entered we may be pretty sure that he had exchanged his
      travelling dress for a more imposing toilet, and we may be equally certain
      that these two girls had something merry to say about the cut or the
      colour of his garments&mdash;we have abundant record of their <i>badinage</i>
      bearing upon his flamboyant liking for colour, and of his retorts in the
      same spirit. We have seen him strutting to and fro in gay apparel,
      obtrusively calling attention to the beauty of his waistcoat and speaking
      in solemn exaggeration of its importance. The girls were well aware of
      this form of his humour; they appreciated it to the full, and responded to
      it in their merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came the sound of martial music from the square, and the elder
      of the girls, opening the window on its hinges, looked out. A regiment of
      soldiers was turning into the square and would pass the hotel, she said.
      The two girls stood at one window and Goldsmith at another while the march
      past took place. It was not surprising that, glancing up and seeing the
      beautiful pair at the window, the mounted officers at the head of the
      regiment should feel flattered by the attention, nor was it unlikely that
      the others, taking the <i>pas</i> from their superiors, should look up and
      exchange expressions in admiration of the beauty of the young ladies. It
      is recorded that they did so, and that, when the soldiers had marched off,
      the little man at the other window walked up and down the room in anger
      &ldquo;that more attention had been paid to them than to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These are the words of Boswell in concluding his account of the episode,
      which, by the way, he printed with several other stories in illustration
      of the overwhelming vanity and extraordinary envy in Goldsmith's nature.
      As if any human being hearing such a story of the most complete curmudgeon
      would accept the words as spoken seriously! And yet Boswell printed it in
      all solemnity, and hoped that every one who read it would believe that
      Goldsmith, the happy-go-lucky Irishman, was eaten up with envy of the
      admiration given to the two exquisite girls on whom, by the way, be
      conferred immortality; for so long as English literature remains the names
      of the Jessamy Bride and Little Comedy will live. Yes, and so long as
      discriminating people read the story of Goldsmith's envious outburst they
      will not fail to see the true picture of what did actually take place in
      that room in the Lisle hotel&mdash;they will see the little man stalking
      up and down, that solemn face of his more solemn than ever, but the
      twinkle in his eyes revealing itself all the more brightly on this
      account, while he shakes his fists at the ladies and affirms that the
      officers were dolts and idiots to waste their time gazing at them when
      they had a chance &ldquo;of seeing me, madam, me&mdash;<i>me!</i>&rdquo; Surely every
      human being with the smallest amount of imagination will see the little
      man thumping his waistcoat, while the Miss Hornecks hold up their hands
      and go into fits of laughter at that whimsical Dr. Goldsmith, whom they
      had chosen to be their companion on that tour of theirs through France
      with their mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      And surely every one must see them in precisely the same attitude, when
      they read the story in Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>, and notice what
      interpretation has been put upon it by the Scotsman&mdash;hands uplifted
      in amazement and faces &ldquo;o'er-running with laughter&rdquo; at the thought of how
      Mr. Boswell has, for the thousandth time, been made a fool of by some one
      who had picked up the story from themselves and had solemnly narrated it
      to Boswell. But in those days following the publication of the first
      edition of the <i>Life</i>, people were going about with uplifted hands,
      wondering if any man since the world began had ever been so befooled as
      Boswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the story appeared in <i>Johnson's Life</i> the two girls had been
      married for several years; but one of them at least had not forgotten the
      incident upon which it was founded; and upon its being repeated in
      Northcote's <i>Life of Reynolds</i>, she wrote to the biographer, assuring
      him that in this, as well as in other stories of the same nature, the
      expression on Goldsmith's face when he professed to be overcome by envy
      was such as left no one in doubt that he was jesting. But Croker, in spite
      of this, had the impudence to sneer at the explanation, and to attribute
      it to the good-nature of the lady. Mr. Croker seems to have had a special
      smile of his own for the weaknesses of ladies. This was the way he smiled
      when he was searching up old registries of their birth in his endeavour to
      prove that they had made themselves out to be six months younger than they
      really were. (Quite different, however, must his smile have been when he
      read Macaulay's Essay on Croker's edition of Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>).
      But, unhappily for poor Goldsmith, Mr. Boswell was able to bring forward
      much stronger evidence of the consuming Vanity, the parent of Envy, with
      which his &ldquo;honest Dr. Goldsmith&rdquo; was afflicted. There was once an
      exhibition of puppets in Panton Street, and on some member of the
      distinguished company in which he, curiously enough for such a
      contemptible lout, constantly found himself, admiring the dexterity with
      which the wooden figure tossed a halbert, Goldsmith, we are gravely told,
      appeared annoyed and said: &ldquo;Pshaw! I could do it as well myself!&rdquo;
       Supposing that some one had said to Boswell, &ldquo;After all, sir, perhaps Dr.
      Goldsmith could have done it as well himself,&rdquo; would the man have tried to
      explain that the question was not whether Goldsmith or the puppet was the
      more dexterous, but whether it was possible to put any other construction
      upon Goldsmith's exclamation than that assumed by Mr. Boswell?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet another instance is given of Goldsmith's envy, and this time the
      object of it is not a wooden figure, but Shakespeare himself. He could not
      bear, Dr. Beattie tells us, that so much admiration should be given to
      Shakespeare. Hearing this, we feel that we are on quite a different level.
      There is no jealousy rankling this time in Goldsmith's heart against a
      mere puppet. It is now a frantic passion of chagrin that Shakespeare
      should still receive the admiration of a chosen few!
    </p>
    <p>
      But such vanity as that so strikingly illustrated by this last told story,
      is, one must confess with feelings of melancholy, not yet wholly extinct
      among literary men. It would scarcely be believed&mdash;unless by Boswell
      or Beattie&mdash;that even in America a man with some reputation as a
      writer should deliberately ask people to assume that he himself was worthy
      of a place in a group that included not merely Shakespeare, but also
      Milton and Homer. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said this egregious person at a public
      dinner, &ldquo;Gentlemen, think of the great writers who are dead and gone.
      There was Shakespeare, he is dead and gone; and Milton, alas! is no longer
      in the land of the living; Homer has been deceased for a considerable
      time, and I myself, gentlemen, am not feeling very well to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a pity it is that Beattie has gone the way of so many other great
      writers. If he could only have been laid on to Mark Twain we should have
      the most comic biography ever written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith was, according to the great Boswell and the many lesser Boswells
      of his day, the most contemptible wretch that ever wrote the finest poem
      of the century, the finest comedy of the century, the finest romance of
      the century. He was a silly man, an envious man, an empty-headed man, a
      stuttering fool, an idiot (of the inspired variety), an awkward lout, a
      shallow pedant, and a generally ridiculous person; and yet here we find
      him the chosen companion of two of the most beautiful and charming young
      ladies in England on their tour through France, and on terms of such
      intimacy with them and their brother, an officer in the Guards and the
      son-in-law of a peer, that nicknames are exchanged between them. A
      singular position for an Irish lout to find himself in!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before he is known to fame, and familiar only with famine, he is
      visited in his garret by Dr. Percy, a member of the great Northumberland
      family at whose town house he lived. So much for the empty-headed fool who
      never opened his mouth except to put his foot in it, as a countryman of
      his said about quite another person. He was a shallow prig, and yet when
      &ldquo;the Club&rdquo; was started not one of the original members questioned his
      right to a place among the most fastidious of the community, although
      Garrick&mdash;to the shame of Johnson be it spoken&mdash;was not admitted
      for nine years. Boswell&mdash;to the shame of Johnson be it spoken&mdash;was
      allowed to crawl in after an exclusion of ten. According to his numerous
      detractors, this Goldsmith was one of the most objectionable persons
      possible to imagine, and yet we find him the closest friend of the
      greatest painter of the day and the greatest actor of the day. He
      associates with peers on the friendliest terms, and is the idol of their
      daughters. He is accused, on the one hand, of aiming at being accounted a
      Macaroni and being extravagant in his dress, and yet he has such a
      reputation for slovenliness in this respect that it is recorded that Dr.
      Johnson, who certainly never was accused of harbouring unworthy
      aspirations to be accounted a beau, made it a point of putting on his best
      garments&mdash;he may even have taken the extreme step of fastening up his
      garters&mdash;before visiting Goldsmith, in order, as he explained, that
      the latter might have no excuse for his slovenliness. We are also told
      that Goldsmith made a fool of himself when he got on his feet to make a
      speech, and yet it is known that he travelled through Europe, winning the
      hospitality of more than one university by the display of his skill as a
      disputant. Again, none of his innumerable traits of awkwardness is so
      widely acknowledged as his conversational, and yet the examples which
      survive of his impromptu wit are of the most finished type; and (even when
      the record is made by Boswell), when he set himself out to take opposite
      sides to Johnson, he certainly spoke better sense than his antagonist,
      though he was never so loud. It is worth noting that nearly all the hard
      things which Johnson is reported to have said respecting Goldsmith were
      spoken almost immediately after one of these disputes. Further, we are
      assured that Goldsmith's learning was of the shallowest order, and yet
      when he was appointed Professor of History to the Royal Academy we do not
      hear that any voice was raised in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a simple reader to think when brought face to face with such
      contradictory accounts of the man and his attainments? Well, possibly the
      best one can do is to say, as Fanny Burney did, that Goldsmith was an
      extraordinary man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, so far as his writings are concerned there is no need for one
      to say much. They speak for themselves, and readers can form their own
      opinion on every line and every sentence that has come from his pen. There
      is no misunderstanding the character of <i>The Traveller</i> or <i>The
      Deserted Village</i> or <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>. These are
      acknowledged by the whole world to be among the most precious legacies of
      the eighteenth century to posterity. Who reads nowadays, except out of
      curiosity, such classics as <i>Tristram Shandy, Clarissa Harlow, Evelina,
      or Rasselas?</i> But who has not read, and who does not still read for
      pleasure, <i>The Vicar of Wakefield?</i> Johnson's laborious poem, <i>The
      Vanity of Human Wishes</i>, now only exists as an example of the last gasp
      of the didactic in verse; but we cannot converse without quoting&mdash;sometimes
      unconsciously&mdash;from <i>The Deserted Village</i> When the
      actor-manager of a theatre wishes to show how accomplished a company he
      has at his disposal he produces <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, and he would
      do so more frequently only he is never quite able to make up his mind
      whether he himself should play the part of old Hardcastle, Tony Lumpkin,
      Young Marlow, or Diggory. But what other eighteenth-century comedy of all
      produced previous to the death of Goldsmith can any manager revive
      nowadays with any hope of success? Colman of the eighteenth century is as
      dead as Congreve of the seventeenth; and what about the masterpieces of
      Cumberland, and Kelly, and Whitehead, and the rest? What about the Rev.
      Mr. Home's <i>Douglas</i>, which, according to Dr. Johnson, was equal to
      Shakespeare at his best? They have all gone to the worms, and these not
      even bookworms&mdash;their very graves are neglected. But <i>She Stoops to
      Conquer</i> is never revived without success&mdash;never without a modern
      audience recognising the fact that its characters are not the puppets of
      the playwright, but the creations of Nature. It is worthy of mention, too,
      that the play which first showed the capacity of an actress whose name was
      ever at the head of the list of actresses of the last generation, was
      founded on <i>The Vicar of Wakefield.</i> It was Miss Ellen Terry's
      appearance in <i>Olivia</i> in 1878 that brought about her connection with
      the ever memorable Lyceum management as an associate of the greatest actor
      of our day.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things speak for themselves, and prove incontestably that Goldsmith
      was head and shoulders above all those writers with whom he was on
      intimate terms. But the mystery of the contradictory accounts which we
      have of the man himself and his ways remains as unsolved as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, unless we assume one thing, namely&mdash;that the majority of the
      people about him were incapable of understanding him. Is it going too far
      to suggest that, as Daniel Defoe was sent to the pillory because his
      ironic jest in <i>The Shortest Way with the Dissenters</i> was taken in
      earnest, and as good people shuddered at the horrible proposal of Swift
      that Irish babies should be cooked and eaten, so Goldsmith's peculiarities
      of humour were too subtle to be in any degree appreciated by most of the
      people with whom he came in contact in England?
    </p>
    <p>
      In Ireland there would be no chance of his being misunderstood; for there
      no form that his humour assumed would be regarded as peculiar. Irony is a
      figure of speech so largely employed by the inhabitants in some parts that
      people who have lived there for any length of time have heard whole
      conversations carried on by two or three men without the slightest
      divergence from this tortuous form of expression into the straight path of
      commonplace English. And all this time there was no expression but one of
      complete gravity on the faces of the speakers; a stranger had no clue
      whatsoever to the game of words that was being played before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fully recognised form of humour which prevails in Ireland is even
      more difficult for a stranger to follow; its basis consists in mystifying
      another person, not for the sake of getting a laugh from a third who has
      been let into the secret, but simply for the satisfaction of the mystifier
      himself. The forms that such a scheme of humour may assume are various.
      One of the most common is an affectation of extraordinary stupidity. It is
      usually provoked by the deliverance of a platitude by a stranger. The
      humourist pretends that he never heard such a statement before, and asks
      to have it repeated. When this is done, there is usually a pause in which
      the profoundest thought is suggested; then the clouds are seen to clear
      away, and the perplexity on the man's face gives way to intelligence; he
      has grasped the meaning of the phrase at last, and he announces his
      victory with sparkling eyes, and forthwith puts quite a wrong construction
      upon the simplest words. His chuckling is brought to a sudden stop by the
      amazed protest of the victim against the suggested solution of the
      obvious. Thus, with consummate art, the man is led on to explain at
      length, with ridiculous emphasis, the exact meaning of his platitude; but
      it is all to no purpose. The humourist shakes his head; he pretends that
      the cleverness of the other is too much for him to grasp all in a moment;
      it's a fine thing to have learning, to be sure, but these things may be
      best not meddled with by ignorant creatures like himself; and so he goes
      off murmuring his admiration for the fine display of wisdom that comes so
      easy-like from the man whom he has been fooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This form of humour is indulged in by some Irishmen simply for the
      satisfaction it gives them to indulge in it. They never hurry off to
      acquaint a neighbour with what they have done, and they are quite pleased
      with the thought that the person on whom they have been imposing will tell
      the whole story of their extraordinary obtuseness to some one else; it
      never strikes them that that some one else may fail to see through the
      trick, and actually be convinced of the existence of their obtuseness. But
      if such a possibility did occur to them, they would be all the better
      pleased: they would feel that they had fooled two instead of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of course, the most widely recognised form of Irish humour is that
      known as the &ldquo;bull.&rdquo; This is the delivery of a paradox so obvious as to be
      detected&mdash;after a brief consideration&mdash;by an Englishman or even&mdash;after
      an additional space for thought&mdash;by a Scotsman. But where the fun
      comes in is (in the Irishman's eyes) when the others assume that the
      humour of the bull is involuntary; and this is just what the Englishman
      has been doing, and what the Irishman has been encouraging him to do, for
      centuries. The Englishman is so busy trying to make it appear that he is
      cleverer than he really is, he cannot see the humour of any man trying to
      make out that he is more stupid than he really is. Let no one fancy for a
      moment that the humour of an Irish bull is involuntary. It is a form of
      expression that may be due to a peculiar twist in the Irishman's mind&mdash;indeed,
      every form of humour may be said to be due to a peculiar twist of the mind&mdash;but
      it is as much a figure of speech as irony or satire. &ldquo;Blarney&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;palaver&rdquo; are other forms of speech in which the Irish of some generations
      ago indulged with great freedom, and both are essentially Irish and
      essentially humorous, though occasionally borrowed and clumsily worn on
      the other side of the Channel, just as the bernous of the Moor is worn by
      an English missionary when lecturing in the village schoolroom (with a
      magic-lantern) on The Progress of Christianity in Morocco.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be interesting to make a scientific inquiry into the origin and
      the maintenance of all these forms of expression among the Irish; but it
      is unnecessary to do so in this place. It is enough if we remind English
      readers of the existence of such forms even in the present day, when there
      is so little need for their display. It can without difficulty be
      understood by any one, however superficially acquainted with the history
      of Ireland for the past thousand years, that &ldquo;blarney&rdquo; and &ldquo;palaver&rdquo; were
      as necessary to the existence of the natives of the island as suspicion
      and vigilance were to the existence of the invaders. But it is not so
      apparent why Irishmen should be given to rush into the extremes of
      bragging on the one hand, and self-depreciation on the other. Bragging is,
      however, as much an endowment of Nature for the protection of a species or
      a race as is imitation or mimicry. The Irishman who was able by the
      exercise of this gift to intimidate the invaders, escaped a violent death
      and transmitted his art to his children. The practice of the art of
      self-depreciation was quite as necessary for the existence of the Irish
      race up to the time of the passing of the first Land Act. For several
      generations an Irishman was not allowed to own a horse of greater value
      than five pounds; and every Irish agriculturist who improved the miserable
      cabin which he was supposed to share with his pigs and his fowl, might
      rest certain that his rent would be raised out of all proportion to his
      improvements. In these circumstances it can easily be understood that it
      was accounted a successful joke for a man who was doing tolerably well to
      put on a poor face when in the presence of an inquiry agent of the absent
      landlord&mdash;to run down all his own efforts and to depreciate generally
      his holding, and thus to save himself from the despicable treatment which
      was meted out to the unfortunate people by the conquerors of their
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to do more than make these suggestions to a scientific
      investigator who may be disposed to devote some time to the question of
      the origin of certain forms of Irish humour; it is enough for us, in
      considering the mystery of that typical Irishman, Oliver Goldsmith, to
      know that such forms of humour as we have specified have an actual
      existence. Such knowledge is a powerful illuminant to a reader of
      Boswell's and Beattie's stories of the stupidity of Goldsmith. A fine
      flood of light is thrown upon the apparent mystery of the inspiration of
      this idiot&mdash;of this man &ldquo;who wrote like an angel and talked like poor
      poll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith was just too successful in maintaining that gravity which is the
      very essence of those forms of humour in which he was constantly indulging
      for his own satisfaction; the mask of gravity was such a good fit that the
      short-sighted people who were around him never penetrated it. He was
      making fools of the people about him, never giving a thought to the
      possibility that they would transmit to posterity the impression which his
      attitude conveyed to them, which was that he was a shallow fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it would be as absurd to contend that Goldsmith never made a
      fool of himself as it would be to assume that Johnson never made a fool of
      himself, or that Boswell ever failed to do so. The occasions upon which he
      made himself ridiculous must have been numerous, but out of the many
      incidents which Boswell and Beattie and Cooke and the others bring forward
      as proofs of his stupidity there are few that will not bear to be
      interpreted as instances of his practice of a form of humour well known in
      Ireland. If his affectation of chagrin at the admiration given to the
      Panton Street puppets, followed by the boast, &ldquo;I could do it as well
      myself,&rdquo; was not humorous, then indeed there is nothing humorous under the
      sun. If his object of setting the room roaring with laughter was not
      achieved the night when at the club he protested that the oratory of Burke
      was nothing&mdash;that all oratory, as a matter of fact, was only a knack&mdash;and
      forthwith stood upon a chair and began to stutter, all that can be said is
      that the famous club at Gerrard Street was more stolid than could be
      believed. If his strutting about the room where he and his friends were
      awaiting a late-comer to dinner, entreating Johnson and the rest to pay
      particular attention to the cut of his new peach-bloom coat, and declaring
      that Filby, his tailor, had told him that when any one asked him who had
      made the garment he was not to forget Filby's address, did not help
      materially to enliven the tedium of that annoying wait, all that can be
      said is that Thrale, as well as Boswell, must have been of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a novelist, anxious to depict a typical humorous Irishman, were to show
      his hero acting as Boswell says Goldsmith acted, would not every reader
      acknowledge that he was true to the character of a comical Irishman? If a
      playwriter were to put the scene on the stage, would any one in the
      audience fail to see that the Goldsmith of the piece was fooling? Every
      one in the club&mdash;Boswell best of all&mdash;was aware of the fact that
      Goldsmith had the keenest admiration for Burke, and that he would be the
      last man in the world to decry his powers. As for the peach-bloom coat, it
      had been the butt of much jesting on the part of his friends; the elder of
      the Miss Hornecks had written him a letter of pretty &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; about it, all
      of which he took in good part. He may have bought the coat originally
      because he liked the tint of the velvet; but assuredly when he found that
      it could be made the subject of a jest he did not hesitate to jest upon it
      himself. How many times have we not seen in Ireland a man behave in
      exactly the same way under similar conditions&mdash;a boisterous young
      huntsman who had put on pink for the first time, and was strutting with
      much pride before an admiring group of servants, every one of whom had
      some enthusiastic remark to make about the fit of the coat, until at last
      the youth, pointing out the perfection of the gilt buttons, murmured: &ldquo;Oh,
      but isn't this a great day for Ireland!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a pity it was that Mr. Boswell had not been present at such a scene!
      Can we not hear his comments upon the character of the young man who had
      actually been so carried away by his vanity that he was heard to express
      the opinion that the fortunes of his country would be materially affected
      by the fact of the buttons of his new coat being gilt? (It was this same
      Mr. Boswell, the critic of Goldsmith's all too attractive costume, who,
      when going to see Pitt for the first time, put on Corsican native dress,
      pretending that he did so in order to interest Pitt in General Paoli.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In reading these accounts of Goldsmith's ways and the remarks of his
      associates it must be noticed that some of these gentlemen had now and
      again an uneasy impression that there was more in the poet's stupidity
      than met the eye. Sir Joshua Reynolds was his closest friend, and it was
      the business of the painter to endeavour to get below the surface of his
      sitters. The general idea that prevails in the world is that he was rather
      successful in his attempts to reproduce, not merely their features, but
      their characters as well; and Sir Joshua saw enough beneath the rude
      exterior of the man to cause him to feel toward Goldsmith as he felt for
      none of his other friends. When the news of his death was brought to the
      painter, he laid down his brushes and spent the day in seclusion. When it
      is remembered that he spent every day of the week, not even excepting
      Sunday, in his studio, the depth of his grief for the loss of his friend
      will be understood. Upon more than one occasion Reynolds asserted that
      Goldsmith was diverting himself by trying to make himself out to be more
      stupid than he really was. Malone, whose judgment was rarely at fault,
      whether it was exercised in the detection of fraud or in the discovery of
      genius, was in perfect agreement with Reynolds on this point, and was
      always ready to affirm that Boswell was unjust in his remarks upon
      Goldsmith and the conclusions to which he came in respect of his
      character. It is not necessary for one to have an especially vivid
      imagination to enable one to see what was the expression on Malone's face
      when he came upon the patronising passage in the <i>Life of Johnson</i> in
      which Boswell stated that for his part he was always glad to hear &ldquo;honest
      Dr. Goldsmith&rdquo; converse. &ldquo;Puppy!&rdquo; cried Johnson upon one occasion when a
      certain commentator had patronised a text out of all recognition. What
      would he have said had he heard Goldsmith patronised by Boswell?
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as Goldsmith's actual vanity is concerned, all that can be said at
      this time is that had it existed in the offensive form which it assumes in
      some of Boswell's stories, Goldsmith would never have won the friendship
      of those men and women who were his friends before he had made a
      reputation for himself by the publication of <i>The 'Traveller</i>. If he
      had had an extravagant opinion of his own capacity as a poet, he would
      certainly never have suffered Johnson to make an attempt to improve upon
      one of his poems; but Goldsmith not only allowed him to do so, but
      actually included the lines written by Johnson when he published the poem.
      Had he been eaten up by vanity, he would not have gone wandering down the
      Mall in St. James's Park while his comedy was being played for the first
      time before a delighted house. The really vain man was the author of The
      Vanity of Human Wishes, who bought the showiest set of garments he could
      find and sat in all their glory in the front row of the boxes on the night
      when Garrick produced his tragedy of <i>Irene</i>&mdash;Garrick whom he
      kept out of the Club for nine years simply because the actor had expressed
      a wish to become one of the original members. The really vain man was the
      one who made his stock story his account of his conversation with the King
      in the Royal Library. Every one sees this now, and every one saw it,
      except Boswell, when the <i>Life</i> was flung in the face of a convulsed
      public, for the public of the year 1791 were as little aware of the real
      value of the book as the author was of the true character of his hero and
      his hero's friend Goldsmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, there would be no better way of arriving at a just conclusion
      on the subject of Goldsmith's stupidity than by submitting the whole of
      the case to an ordinary man accustomed to the many peculiarities of
      Irishmen, especially in the exercise of their doubtful gift of humour.
      &ldquo;Here is a man,&rdquo; we must say, &ldquo;who became the most intimate friend of
      people of title and the dearest friend of many men of brains. When the
      most exclusive Club of the day was started his place as a member was not
      disputed, even by the man who invented the word 'clubbable,' and knew what
      it meant into the bargain; when the Royal Academy of Arts was started he
      was invited to become one of its professors. Some of the wittiest things
      recorded by the most diligent recorder of witty things that the world has
      ever known, were uttered by him. Upon one occasion when walking among the
      busts of the poets in Westminster Abbey with a friend, the latter pointing
      around said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving the Abbey and walking down the Strand to Temple Bar they saw the
      heads of the men who had been captured and decapitated for taking part in
      the Rebellion of the year 1745, bleaching in the winds in accordance with
      the terms of the sentence for high treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis</i>,' murmured the man of
      whom we speak. Upon another occasion this same friend of his, who had a
      unique reputation for speaking in the most ponderous language, even when
      dealing with the simplest matters, asserted that the writing of the
      dialogue in some recently published fables where fish were represented as
      conversing, was very simple. 'Not so simple at all,' said the other, 'for
      were you to write them, you would make every minnow talk like a whale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the course of a few years, in addition to compiling histories, which
      remained standard educational works for more than a century, and several
      other books, he wrote a novel which received the highest praise from the
      greatest intellects in Europe, and which is still read with delight by
      thousands of people of all nationalities; a poem of which almost every
      line is quoted daily in conversation&mdash;a poem which contains metaphors
      that have been repeated for generations in the Senate, in the Court of
      Law, and in the Church; and a play which has been pronounced the truest
      comedy in the English language. He died at an early age, and a memorial of
      his genius was given a place in Westminster Abbey. The inscription was
      written by the most distinguished man of letters in England, and although
      highly eulogistic, was considered by the greatest painter in the world and
      the greatest orator in the world to fall short of doing justice to the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, on the other hand, the man of whom we speak was said by a Scotchman,
      who himself was occasionally referred to as a cur and sometimes as an ape,
      and more than once as a coxcomb, to have been roused to a frenzy of envy,
      because some officers, passing through a square in a French town, looked
      admiringly at two lovely girls who were at a window, ignoring him at
      another window; and again because his friends spoke with favour of the
      dexterity of a wooden figure dressed as a soldier, and yet again (on
      another authority) because one of his friends read a passage from
      Shakespeare, and affirmed that it was magnificent. Now, would you say,&rdquo; we
      should ask the authority to whom we are supposed to be stating a case&mdash;&ldquo;would
      you say that this man was in earnest when, in the first of the instances
      quoted, he walked up and down the room in the French hotel asserting 'that
      although the young ladies, of whom he was extremely fond, might have their
      admirers, there were places where he, too, was given admiration'? Would
      you say that he showed ill-temper or wit when, in the second instance, he
      declared with warmth that he could toss a halbert quite as well as any
      wooden figure? Would you say that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But we should not get any further than this in stating our case to a man
      acquainted with the Irish and their humour: he would think that we were
      taking a leaf out of the book of Irish humour, and endeavouring to fool
      him by asking him to pronounce a grave opinion upon the obvious; he would
      not stay to give us a chance of asking him whether he thought that the
      temptation of making &ldquo;Noll&rdquo; rhyme with &ldquo;Poll,&rdquo; was not too great to be
      resisted by the greatest farceur of his time, in the presence of a
      humorous colleague called Oliver; and whether an impecunious but witty
      Irishman begged his greatest friend not to give him the nickname of Goldy,
      because his dignity was hurt thereby, or simply because it was tantalising
      for one to be called &ldquo;Goldy,&rdquo; whose connection with gold was usually so
      transitory.
    </p>
    <p>
      If people will only read the stories told of poor Goldsmith's vanity, and
      envy, and coxcombry, with a handbook of Irish humour beside them, the
      conclusion to which they will come must, we think, be that Goldsmith was
      an Irishman, and that, on the whole, he made very good fun of Boswell, who
      was a Scotsman, but that in the long run Boswell got very much the better
      of him. Scotsmen usually laugh last.

    <h2>
      THE BEST COMEDY OF THE CENTURY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E occupied one
      room in the farmhouse&mdash;the guest-chamber it had probably been called
      when the farm was young. It was a pretty spacious apartment up one pair of
      stairs and to the right of the landing, and from its window there was a
      pleasing prospect of a paddock with wheat-fields beyond; there was a drop
      in the landscape in the direction of Hendon, and here was a little wood.
      The farmer's name was Selby, a married man with a son of sixteen, and
      younger children, and the farmhouse was the nearest building to the sixth
      milestone on the Edgware Road in the year 1771.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was invariably alluded to as &ldquo;The Gentleman,&rdquo; and the name did very
      well for him, situated as he was in the country; in the town and among his
      acquaintances it would serve badly as a means of identification. He was
      never referred to as &ldquo;The Gentleman&rdquo; of his circle. In his room in the
      farmhouse there was his bed and table&mdash;a large table littered with
      books; it took two chaises to carry his books hither from his rooms in the
      Temple. Here he sat and wrote the greater part of the day, and when he was
      very busy he would scarcely be able to touch the meals which were sent up
      to him from the kitchen. But he was by no means that dignified type of the
      man of letters who would shrink from fellowship with the farmer or his
      family. He would frequently come down his stairs into the kitchen and
      stand with his back to the fire, conversing with the housewife, and
      offering her his sympathy when she had made him aware of the fact that the
      privilege of being the wife of a substantial farmer, though undoubtedly
      fully recognised by the world, carried many troubles in its train, not
      only in connection with the vicissitudes of churning, but in regard to the
      feeding of the calves, which no man could attend to properly, and the
      making of the damson and cowslip wine. He told her that the best maker of
      cowslip wine whom he had ever met was a Mrs. Primrose; her husband had at
      one time occupied the Vicarage of Wakefield&mdash;he wondered if Mrs.
      Selby had ever heard of her. Mrs. Selby's knowledge did not go so far, but
      she thought that Mrs. Primrose's recipe must be a good one indeed if it
      brought forth better results than her own; and the gentleman said that
      although he had never tasted Mrs. Selby's he would still have no
      hesitation in backing it for flavour, body, headiness, and all other
      qualities associated with the distillation of the cowslip, against the
      Primrose brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he would stare at the gammon in the rafter and mutter some words,
      burst into a roar of laughter, and stumble upstairs to his writing,
      leaving the good woman to thank Heaven that she was the wife of a
      substantial farmer and not of an unsubstantial gentleman of letters, who
      could not carry on a simple conversation without having some queer thought
      fly across his brain for all the world like one of the swallows on the
      water at Hendon, only maybe a deal harder to catch. She knew that the
      gentleman had hurried to his paper and ink to complete the capture of that
      fleet-flitting thought which had come to him when he had cast his eyes
      toward the gammon, though how an idea worth putting on paper&mdash;after a
      few muttered words and a laugh&mdash;could lurk about a common piece of
      hog's-flesh was a mystery to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then upon occasions the gentleman would take a walk abroad; the
      farmer's son had more than once come upon him strolling about the fields
      with his hands in his pockets and his head bent toward the ground, still
      muttering fitfully and occasionally giving a laugh that made the grey pad
      in the paddock look up slowly, still munching the grass. Now and again he
      paid a visit to his friend Mr. Hugh Boyd at the village of Kenton, and
      once he returned late at night from such a visit, without his shoes. He
      had left them in a quagmire, he said, and it was only with a struggle that
      he saved himself from being engulfed as well. That was the story of his
      shoes which young Selby remembered when he was no longer young. And there
      was another story which he remembered, but it related to his slippers. The
      fact was that the gentleman had acquired the bad habit of reading in bed,
      and the table on which his candlestick stood being several feet away from
      his pillow, he saved himself the trouble of rising to extinguish it by
      flinging a slipper at it. In the morning the overturned candle was usually
      found side by side on the floor with an unaccountably greasy slipper. This
      method of discharging an important domestic duty differed considerably
      from Johnson's way of compassing the same end. Johnson, being extremely
      short-sighted, was compelled to hold the candle close to the book when
      reading in bed, so that he had no need to use his slipper as an
      extinguisher. No, but he found his pillow very handy for this purpose.
      When he had finished his reading he threw away the book and went asleep
      with his candle under his pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman at the farm went about a good deal in his slippers, and with
      his shirt loose at the collar&mdash;the latter must have been but one of
      his very customary negligences, or Sir Joshua Reynolds would not have
      painted him thus. Doubtless the painter had for long recognised the
      interpretative value of this loosened collar above that of the velvet and
      silk raiment in which the man sometimes appeared before the wondering eyes
      of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the painter had never had an opportunity of studying the
      picturesqueness of his negligence, he had more than one chance of doing so
      within the farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Selby recollected that upon at least one occasion Sir Joshua, his
      friend Sir William Chambers, and Dr. Johnson had paid a visit to the
      gentleman who lodged at the farm. He remembered that for that reception of
      so distinguished a company the farmhouse parlour had been opened and tea
      provided. There must have been a good deal of pleasant talk between the
      gentleman and his friends at this time, and probably young Selby heard an
      astonishingly loud laugh coming from the enormous visitor with the brown
      coat and the worsted stockings, as the gentleman endeavoured to tell his
      guests something of the strange scenes which he was introducing in the
      comedy he was writing in that room upstairs. It was then a comedy without
      a name, but young Selby heard that it was produced the following year in
      London and that it was called <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the second year that the gentleman had spent at the farm. The
      previous summer he had been engaged on another work which was certainly as
      comical as the comedy. It was called <i>Animated Nature</i>, and it
      comprised some of the most charmingly narrated errors in Natural History
      ever offered to the public, and the public have always been delighted to
      read pages of fiction if it is only called &ldquo;Natural History.&rdquo; This is one
      of the best-established facts in the history of the race. After all, <i>Animated
      Nature</i> was true to half its title: every page was animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while he was so engaged, with one eye on Buffon and another on his
      MS., that he found Farmer Selby very useful to him. Farmer Selby knew a
      great deal about animals&mdash;the treatment of horses under various
      conditions, and the way to make pigs pay; he had probably his theories
      respecting the profit to be derived from keeping sheep, and how to feed
      oxen that are kept for the plough. All such knowledge he must have placed
      at the disposal of the author, though the farmer was possibly too careless
      an observer of the simple incidents of the fields to be able to verify
      Buffon's statement, reproduced in Animated Nature, to the effect that cows
      shed their horns every two years; he was probably also too deficient in
      the spirit in which a poet sets about the work of compilation to be able
      to assent to the belief that a great future was in store for the zebra
      when it should become tame and perform the ordinary duties of a horse. But
      if the author was somewhat discouraged in his speculations now and again
      by Farmer Selby, he did not allow his fancy as a naturalist to be wholly
      repressed. He had heard a story of an ostrich being ridden horsewise in
      some regions, and of long journeys being accomplished in this way in
      incredibly short spaces of time, and forthwith his imagination enabled him
      to see the day when this bird would become as amenable to discipline as
      the barn-door fowl, though discharging the tasks of a horse, carrying its
      rider across England with the speed of a racer!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while he was engaged on this pleasant work of fancy and imagination
      that Mr. Boswell paid him a visit, bringing with him as a witness Mr.
      Mickle, the translator of the Lusiad. &ldquo;The Gentleman&rdquo; had gone away for
      the day, Mrs. Selby explained; but she did not know Mr. Boswell. She could
      not prevent him from satisfying his curiosity in respect of Dr. Goldsmith.
      He went upstairs to his room, and he was fully satisfied. He found the
      walls all scrawled over with outline drawings of quite a number of
      animals. Having thus satisfied himself that the author of <i>Animated
      Nature</i> was working in a thoroughly conscientious manner he came away.
      He records the incident himself, but he does not say whether or not he was
      able to recognise any of the animals from their pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now it was a professed and not an unconscious comedy that occupied Dr.
      Goldsmith. Whatever disappointment he may have felt at the indifferent
      success of the first performance of <i>The Good-Natured Man</i>&mdash;and
      he undoubtedly felt some&mdash;had been amply redeemed by the money which
      accrued to him from the &ldquo;author's rights&rdquo; and the sale of the play; and he
      had only awaited a little encouragement from the managers to enable him to
      begin another comedy. But the managers were not encouraging, and he was
      found by his friends one day to be full of a scheme for the building of a
      new theatre for the production of new plays, in order that the existing
      managers might not be able to carry on their tyranny any longer. Such a
      scheme has been revived every decade since Goldsmith's time, but never
      with the least success. Johnson, whose sound sense was rarely at fault,
      laughed at the poet's project for bringing down the mighty from their
      seats, upon which Goldsmith cried: &ldquo;Ay, sir, this matter may be nothing to
      you who can now shelter yourself behind the corner of your pension,&rdquo; and
      he doubtless went on to describe the condition of the victims of the
      tyranny of which he complained; but it is questionable if his doing so
      effected more than to turn Johnson's laughter into another and a wider
      channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Goldsmith spoke feelingly. He was certainly one of the ablest writers
      of the day, but no pension was ever offered to him, though on every hand
      bounties were freely bestowed on the most indifferent and least deserving
      of authors&mdash;men whose names were forgotten before the end of the
      century, and during the lifetime of the men themselves remembered only by
      the pay clerk to the almoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the scheme for bringing the managers to their senses never
      reached a point of serious consideration; and forthwith Goldsmith began to
      illustrate, for the benefit of posterity, the depths to which the
      stupidity of the manager of a play-house can occasionally fall. The public
      have always had abundant proofs of the managers' stupidity afforded them
      in the form of the plays which they produce; but the history of the
      production of the most brilliant comedy of the eighteenth century is
      practically unique; for it is the history of the stupidity of a manager
      doing his best to bring about the failure of a play which he was producing
      at his own theatre. He had predicted the failure of the piece, and it must
      strike most people that the manager of a theatre who produces for a
      failure will be as successful in compassing his end as a jockey who rides
      for a fall. Colman believed that he was in the fortunate position of those
      prophets who had the realisation of their predictions in their own hands.
      He was mistaken in this particular case. Although he was justified on
      general principles in assuming his possession of this power, yet he had
      made no allowance for the freaks of genius. He was frustrated in his
      amiable designs by this incalculable force&mdash;this power which he had
      treated as a <i>quantité négligeable</i>. A man who has been accustomed
      all his life to count only on simple ability in the people about him, is,
      on suddenly being brought face to face with genius, like an astronomer who
      makes out his tables of a new object on the assumption that it is a fixed
      star, when all the time it is a comet, upsetting by its erratic course all
      his calculations, and demanding to be reckoned with from a standpoint that
      applies to itself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars of Colman's theatrical firmament were such as might safely be
      counted on; but Goldsmith's genius was not of this order. The manager's
      stupidity lay in his blunt refusal to recognise a work of genius when it
      was brought to him by a man of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that the central idea of the plot of <i>She Stoops to
      Conquer</i> was suggested by an incident that came under Goldsmith's
      notice before he left Ireland. However this may be, it cannot be denied
      that the playing of the practical joke of Tony Lumpkin upon the two
      travellers is &ldquo;very Irish.&rdquo; It would take a respectable place in the list
      of practical jokes of the eighteenth century played in Ireland. In that
      island a collector of incidents for a comedy during the past two centuries
      would require to travel with a fat notebook&mdash;so would the collector
      of incidents for a tragedy. Goldsmith's task may not have been to invent
      the central idea, but to accomplish the much more difficult duty of making
      that incident seem plausible, surrounding it with convincing scenery and
      working it out by the aid of the only characters by which it could be
      worked out with a semblance of being natural. This was a task which genius
      only could fulfil. The room whose walls bore ample testimony to its
      occupant's sense of the comedy of a writer's life, witnessed the supreme
      achievement in the &ldquo;animated nature&rdquo; of <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>. It
      contains the two chief essentials to a true comedy&mdash;animation and
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that the play was constructed and written by Goldsmith
      without an adviser. He was possibly shrewd enough to know that if he were
      to take counsel with any of his friends&mdash;Garrick, Johnson, Reynolds,
      or Colman&mdash;he would not be able to write the play which he had a mind
      to write. The artificial comedy had a vogue that year, and though it may
      have been laughed at in private by people of judgment, yet few of those
      within the literary circle of which Johnson was the acknowledged centre,
      would have had the courage to advise a poet writing a piece in hopes of
      making some money, to start upon a plot as farcical as Nature herself. At
      that period of elegance in art everything that was natural was pronounced
      vulgar. Shakespeare himself had to be made artificial before he could be
      played by Garrick. Goldsmith must have known that his play would be called
      vulgar, and that its chances of being accepted and produced by either of
      the managers in London would be doubtful; but, all the same, he wrote the
      piece in accordance with his own personal views, and many a time during
      the next two years he must have felt that he was a fool for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      However this may be, the play was finished some time in the summer of
      1771; and on September 7th the author was back at his rooms in the Temple
      and writing to his friend Bennet Langton, whom he had promised to visit at
      his place in Lincolnshire. &ldquo;I have been almost wholly in the country at a
      farmer's house, quite alone, trying to write a comedy. It is now finished,
      but when or how it will be acted, or whether it will be acted at all, are
      questions I cannot resolve,&rdquo; he told Langton.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      The misgivings which he had at this time were well founded. He considered
      that the fact of his having obtained from Colman a promise to read any
      play that he might write constituted an obligation on his part to submit
      this piece to Colman rather than to Garrick. He accordingly placed it in
      Colman's hands; but it is impossible to say if the work of elaborate
      revision which Goldsmith began in the spring of 1772 was due to the
      comments made by this manager on the first draft or to the author's
      reconsideration of his work as a whole. But the amended version was
      certainly in Colman's hands in the summer of this year (1772). The
      likelihood is that Colman would have refused point-blank to have anything
      to do with the comedy after he had read the first draft had it not been
      that just at this time Goldsmith's reputation was increased to a
      remarkable extent by the publication of his Histories. It would be
      difficult to believe how this could be, but, as usual, we are indebted to
      Mr. Boswell for what information we have on this point. Boswell had been
      for some time out of London, and on returning he expressed his amazement
      at the celebrity which Goldsmith had attained. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he cried to Johnson,
      &ldquo;Goldsmith has acquired more fame than all the officers last war who were
      not generals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;you will find ten thousand fit to do what they
      did before you find one who does what Goldsmith has done&rdquo;&mdash;a bit of
      dialogue that reminds one of the reply of the avaricious <i>prima donna</i>
      when the Emperor refused to accede to her terms on the plea that were he
      to pay her her price she would be receiving more than any of his marshals.
      &ldquo;Eh bien, mon sire. Let your marshals sing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, Colman got the play&mdash;and kept it. He would give the
      author no straightforward opinion as to its prospects in his hands. He
      refused to say when he would produce it&mdash;nay, he declined to promise
      that he would produce it at all. Goldsmith was thus left in torment for
      month after month, and the effect of the treatment that he received was to
      bring on an illness, and the effect of his illness was to sink him to a
      depth of despondency that even Goldsmith had never before sounded. The
      story told by Cooke of his coming upon the unhappy man in a coffeehouse,
      and of the latter's attempt to give him some of the details of the plot of
      the comedy, speaks for itself. &ldquo;I shook my head,&rdquo; wrote Cooke, &ldquo;and said
      that I was afraid the audience, under their then sentimental impressions,
      would think it too broad and farcical for comedy.&rdquo; This was poor comfort
      for the author; but after a pause he shook the man by the hand, saying
      piteously: &ldquo;I am much obliged to you, my dear friend, for the candour of
      your opinion, but it is all I can do; for alas! I find that my genius, if
      ever I had any, has of late totally deserted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation is the most piteous that ever came from a man of genius;
      and there can be no doubt of the sincerity of its utterance, for it was
      during these miserable months that he began a new novel, but found himself
      unable to get further than a few chapters. And all this time, when, in
      order to recover his health, he should have had no worries of a lesser
      nature, he was being harassed by the trivial cares of a poor, generous
      man's life&mdash;those mosquito vexations which, accumulating, become more
      intolerable than a great calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had once had great hopes of good resulting from Colman's taking up the
      management of Covent Garden, and had written congratulations to him within
      the first week of his entering into possession of the theatre. A very
      different letter he had now to write to the same man. Colman had
      endeavoured to evade the responsibility of giving him a direct answer
      about the play. He clearly meant that the onus of refusing it should lie
      at the door of some one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&rdquo; wrote the author in January, 1773, &ldquo;I entreat you'll release
      me from that state of suspense in which I have been kept for a long time.
      Whatever objections you have made or shall make to my play I will
      endeavour to remove and not argue about them. To bring in any new judges
      either of its merits or faults I can never submit to. Upon a former
      occasion when my other play was before Mr. Garrick he offered to bring me
      before Mr. Whitehead's tribunal, but I refused the proposal with
      indignation. I hope I shall not experience as hard treatment from you as
      from him.... For God's sake take the play and let us make the best of it,
      and let me have the same measure at least which you have given as bad
      plays as mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon receiving this letter, Colman at once returned to him the manuscript
      of the play, and on the author's unfolding it he found that on the back of
      almost every page, on the blank space reserved for the prompter's
      hieroglyphs, some sneering criticism was scrawled. To emphasise this
      insult Colman had enclosed a letter to the effect that if the author was
      still unconvinced that the piece would be a failure, he, Colman, would
      produce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately on receipt of this contemptible effort at contempt Goldsmith
      packed up the play and sent it to Garrick at Drury Lane. That same
      evening, however, he met Johnson and told him what he had done; and
      Johnson, whose judgment on the practical side of authorship was rarely at
      fault, assured him that he had done wrong and that he must get the
      manuscript back without delay, and submit to Colman's sneers for the sake
      of having the comedy produced. Upon Johnson's promising to visit Colman,
      and to urge upon him the claims of Goldsmith to his consideration, the
      distracted author wrote to Drury Lane:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon more mature deliberation and the advice of a sensible friend, I
      begin to think it indelicate in me to throw upon you the odium of
      confirming Mr. Colman's sentence. I therefore request that you will send
      my play by my servant back; for having been assured of having it acted at
      the other house, though I confess yours in every respect more to my wish,
      yet it would be folly in me to forgo an advantage which lies in my power
      of appealing from Mr. Colman's opinion to the judgment of the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith got back the play, and Johnson explained to him, as he did some
      years later to Reynolds, that the solicitations which he had made to
      Colman to put it in rehearsal without delay amounted almost to force. At
      any rate, the play was announced and the parts distributed to the
      excellent company which Colman controlled. It was soon proved that he
      controlled some members of this company only too well. The spirit in,
      which he set about the discharge of his duties as a manager was apparent
      to every one during the earliest rehearsals. Johnson, writing to an
      American correspondent, mentioned that Colman made no secret of his belief
      that the play would be a failure. Far from it. He seems to have taken the
      most extraordinary trouble to spread his belief far and wide; and when a
      manager adopts such a course, what chance, one may ask, has the play? What
      chance, the players could not but ask, have the players?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was possibly the only occasion in the history of the English drama on
      which such questions could be asked. If managers have a fault at all&mdash;a
      question which is not yet ripe for discussion&mdash;it has never been in
      the direction of depreciating a play which they are about to produce&mdash;that
      is, of course, outside the author's immediate circle. It is only when the
      play has failed that they sometimes allow that it was a bad one, and
      incapable of being saved even by the fine acting of the company and the
      sumptuous mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Colman controlled his company all too well, and after a day or two it
      was announced that the leading lady, the accomplished Mrs. Abington, had
      retired from the part of Miss Hardcastle; that Smith, known as Gentleman
      Smith, had refused to play Young Marlow; and that Woodward, the most
      popular comedian in the company, had thrown up the part of Tony Lumpkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in one day, it seemed that Colman had achieved his aims, and the
      piece would have to be withdrawn by the author. This was undoubtedly the
      managerial view of the situation which had been precipitated by the
      manager, and it was shared by those of the author's friends who understood
      his character as indifferently as did Colman. They must all have been
      somewhat amazed when the author quietly accepted the situation and
      affirmed that he would rather that his play were damned by bad players
      than merely saved by good acting. One of the company who had the sense to
      perceive the merits of the piece, Shuter, the comedian, who was cast for
      the part of old Hardcastle, advised Goldsmith to give Lewes, the
      harlequin, the part of Young Marlow; Quick, a great favourite with the
      public, was to act Tony Lumpkin; and, after a considerable amount of
      wrangling, Mrs. Bulkley, lately Miss Wilford, who had been the Miss
      Richland of <i>The Good-Natured Man</i>, accepted the part which the
      capricious Mrs. Abington resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another start was made with the rehearsals of the piece, and further
      efforts were made by Colman to bring about the catastrophe which he had
      predicted. He refused to let a single scene be painted for the production,
      or to supply a single new dress; his ground being that the money spent in
      this way would be thrown away, for the audience would never allow the
      piece to proceed beyond the second act.
    </p>
    <p>
      But happily Dr. Johnson had his reputation as a prophet at stake as well
      as Colman, and he was singularly well equipped by Nature for enforcing his
      views on any subject. He could not see anything of what was going on upon
      the stage; but his laugh at the succession of humorous things spoken by
      the company must have had an inspiring effect upon every one, except
      Colman. Johnson's laugh was the strongest expression of appreciation of
      humour of which the century has a record. It was epic. To say that
      Johnson's laugh at the rehearsals of <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> saved
      the piece would perhaps be going too far. But can any one question its
      value as a counteracting agent to Colman's depressing influence on the
      stage? Johnson was the only man in England who could make Colman (and
      every one else) tremble, and his laugh had the same effect upon the
      building in which it was delivered. It was the Sirocco against a wet
      blanket. When one thinks of the feeling of awe which was inspired by the
      name of Dr. Johnson, not only during the last forty years of the
      eighteenth century, but well into the nineteenth, one begins to appreciate
      the value of his vehement expression of satisfaction upon the people on
      the stage. Goldsmith dedicated his play to Johnson, and assuredly the
      compliment was well earned. Johnson it was who compelled Colman to produce
      the piece, and Johnson it was who encouraged the company to do their best
      for it, in spite of the fact that they were all aware that their doing
      their best for it would be resented by their manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reynolds also, another valuable friend to the author, sacrificed several
      of his busiest hours in order to attend the rehearsals. His sister's
      sacrifices to the same end were perhaps not quite so impressive, nor were
      those made by that ingenious &ldquo;country gentleman,&rdquo; Mr. Cradock, referred to
      by Walpole. Miss Horneck, his beautiful &ldquo;Jessamy Bride,&rdquo; and her sister,
      lately married to Mr. Bunbury, bore testimony to the strength of their
      friendship for the poet, by accompanying him daily to the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after all, these good friends had not many opportunities of showing
      their regard for him in the same way; for the play must have had
      singularly few rehearsals. Scarcely a month elapsed between the date of
      Colman's receiving the manuscript on its being returned by Garrick and the
      production of the piece. It is doubtful if more than ten rehearsals took
      place after the parts were recast. If the manager kept the author in
      suspense for eighteen months respecting the fate of his play, he
      endeavoured to make up for his dilatoriness now. It was announced for
      Monday, March 15th, and, according to Northcote, it was only on the
      morning of that day that the vexed question of what the title should be
      was settled. For some time the author and his friends had been talking the
      matter over. &ldquo;We are all in labour for a name to Goldy's play,&rdquo; wrote
      Johnson. <i>The Mistakes of a Night, The Old House a New Inn, and The
      Belle's Stratagem</i> were suggested in turn. It was Goldsmith himself who
      gave it the title under which it was produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of this day, March 15th, the author was the guest at a
      dinner-party organised in his honour. It is easy to picture this
      particular function. The truth was that Colman's behaviour had broken the
      spirit not only of the author, but of the majority of his friends as well.
      They would all make an effort to cheer up poor Goldsmith; but every one
      knows how cheerless a function is one that is organised with such
      charitable intentions. It is not necessary that one should have been in a
      court of law watching the face of the prisoner in the dock when the jury
      have retired to consider their verdict in order to appreciate the feelings
      of Goldsmith when his friends made their attempt to cheer him up. The last
      straw added on to the cheerlessness of the banquet was surely to be found
      in the accident that every one wore black! The King of Sardinia had died a
      short time before, and the Court had ordered mourning to be worn for some
      weeks for this potentate. Johnson was very nearly outraging propriety by
      appearing in coloured raiment, but George Steevens, who called for him to
      go to the dinner, was fortunately in time to prevent such a breach of
      etiquette. &ldquo;I would not for ten pounds have seemed so retrograde to any
      general observance,&rdquo; cried Johnson in offering his thanks to his
      benefactor. Happily the proprieties were saved; but what must have been
      the effect of the appearance of these gentlemen in black upon the person
      whom they meant to cheer up!
    </p>
    <p>
      Reynolds told his pupil, Northcote, what effect these resources of gaiety
      had upon Goldsmith. His mouth became so parched that he could neither eat
      nor drink, nor could he so much as speak in acknowledgment of the
      well-meant act of his friends. When the party after this entertainment set
      out for the theatre they must have suggested, all being in black, a more
      sombre procession than one is accustomed to imagine when conjuring up a
      picture of an eighteenth-century theatre party.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Goldsmith was missing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately Boswell was not present, or we should not be left in doubt
      as to how it happened that no one thought of taking charge of Goldsmith.
      But no one seemed to think of him, and so his disappearance was never
      noticed. His friends arrived at the theatre and found their places,
      Johnson in the front row of the boxes; and the curtain was rung up, and
      Goldsmith was forgotten under the influence of that comedy which
      constitutes his greatest claim to be remembered by theatre-goers of
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was found by an acquaintance a couple of hours later wandering in the
      Mall of St. James's Park, and was only persuaded to go to the theatre by
      its being represented to him that his services might be required should it
      be found necessary to alter something at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, among the members of that distinguished audience there was a man
      named Cumberland. He was the author of <i>The West Indian</i> and several
      other plays, and he was regarded as one of the leaders of the sentimental
      school, the demise of which was satirised in the prologue to this very
      play which was being performed. Cumberland was a man who could never see a
      particle of good in anything that was written by another. It was a
      standing entertainment with Garrick to &ldquo;draw him on&rdquo; by suggesting that
      some one had written a good scene in a play, or was about to produce an
      interesting book. In a moment Cumberland was up, protesting against the
      assumption that the play or the book could be worth anything. So wide a
      reputation had he for decrying every other author that when Sheridan
      produced <i>The Critic; or, the Tragedy Rehearsed</i>, his portrait was
      immediately recognised in Sir Fretful Plagiary.
    </p>
    <p>
      What must have been the feelings of this man when, from the first, the
      play, which he had come to wreck, was received by the whole house with
      uproarious applause? Well, we don't know what he felt like, but we know
      what he looked like. One of the newspapers described him as &ldquo;looking
      glum,&rdquo; and another contained a rhymed epigram describing him as weeping.
      Goldsmith entered the theatre by the stage door at the beginning of the
      fifth act, where Tony Lumpkin and his mother appear close to their own
      house, and the former pretends that the chaise has broken down on
      Crackscull Common. He had no sooner got into the &ldquo;wings&rdquo; than he heard a
      hiss. &ldquo;What's that, sir?&rdquo; he whispered to Colman, who was beside him.
      &ldquo;Psha, sir! what signifies a squib when we have been sitting on a barrel
      of gunpowder all night?&rdquo; was the reply. The story is well known; and its
      accuracy has never been im peached. And the next day it was well known
      that that solitary hiss came from Cumberland, the opinion that it was due
      to the malevolence of Macpherson, whose pretensions to the discovery of <i>Ossian</i>
      were exposed by Johnson, being discredited.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the effect of Colman's brutality and falsehood into the bargain had
      not a chance of lasting long. The hiss was received with cries of &ldquo;Turn
      him out!&rdquo; and, with an addition to the tumultuous applause of all the
      house, Goldsmith must have been made aware in another instant of the fact
      that he had written the best comedy of the day and that Colman had lied to
      him. From the first there had been no question of sitting on a barrel of
      gunpowder. Such applause could never greet the last act of a play the
      first four acts of which had been doubtful. He must have felt that at last
      he had conquered&mdash;that he had by one more achievement proved to his
      own satisfaction&mdash;and he was hard to satisfy&mdash;that those friends
      of his who had attributed genius to him had not been mistaken; that those
      who, like Johnson and Percy and Reynolds, had believed in him before he
      had written the work that made him famous, had not been misled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day all London was talking of <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> and of
      Colman. Horace Walpole, who detested Goldsmith, and who found when he went
      to see the play that it was deplorably vulgar, mentioned in a letter which
      he wrote to Lady Ossory on the morning after the production that it had
      &ldquo;succeeded prodigiously,&rdquo; and the newspapers were full of epigrams at the
      expense of the manager. If Colman had had the sense to keep to himself his
      forebodings of the failure of the piece, he would not have left himself
      open to these attacks; but, as has been said, he took as much pains to
      decry the coming production as he usually did to &ldquo;puff&rdquo; other pieces. It
      would seem that every one had for several days been talking about nothing
      else save the coming failure of Dr. Goldsmith's comedy. Only on this
      assumption can one now understand the poignancy of the &ldquo;squibs&rdquo;&mdash;some
      of them partook largely of the character of his own barrel of gunpowder&mdash;levelled
      against Colman. He must have been quite amazed at the clamour that arose
      against him; it became too much for his delicate skin, and he fled to Bath
      to get out of the way of the scurrilous humourists who were making him a
      target for their pop-guns. But even at Bath he failed to find a refuge.
      Writing to Mrs. Thrale, Johnson said: &ldquo;Colman is so distressed with abuse
      that he has solicited Goldsmith to take him off the rack of the
      newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Goldsmith that he should do all that was asked of
      him and that he should make no attempt, either in public or in private, to
      exult in his triumph over the manager. The only reference which he made to
      his sufferings while Colman was keeping him on the rack was in a letter
      which he wrote to his friend Cradock, who had written an epilogue for the
      play, to explain how it was that this epilogue was not used at the first
      representation. After saying simply, &ldquo;The play has met with a success
      beyond your expectation or mine,&rdquo; he makes his explanation, and concludes
      thus: &ldquo;Such is the history of my stage adventure, and which I have at last
      done with. I cannot help saying that I am very sick of the stage, and
      though I believe I shall get three tolerable benefits, yet I shall on the
      whole be a loser, even in a pecuniary light; my ease and comfort I
      certainly lost while it was in agitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith showed that he bore no grudge against Colman; but the English
      stage should bear him a grudge for his treatment of one of the few authors
      of real genius who have contributed to it for the benefit of posterity. If
      <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> had been produced when it first came into the
      manager's hands, Goldsmith would certainly not have written the words just
      quoted. What would have been the result of his accepting the encouragement
      of its production it is, of course, impossible to tell; but it is not
      going too far to assume that the genius which gave the world <i>The
      Good-Natured Man</i> and <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> would have been
      equal to the task of writing a third comedy equal in merit to either of
      these. Yes, posterity owes Colman a grudge.

    <h2>
      THE JESSAMY BRIDE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A PERSONAL NOTE
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR some time after
      the publication of my novel <i>The Jessamy Bride</i> my time was fully
      occupied by replying to correspondents&mdash;strangers to me&mdash;who
      were good enough to take an interest in Mary Horneck, the younger of the
      two charming sisters with whom Goldsmith associated for several years of
      his life on terms of the warmest affection. The majority of these
      communications were of a very interesting character. Only one
      correspondent told me I should not have allowed Oliver Goldsmith to die so
      young, though two expressed the opinion that I should have made Goldsmith
      marry Mary Horneck; nearly all the remaining communications which were
      addressed to me contained inquiries as to the origin of the sobriquet
      applied to Mary Horneck in Goldsmith's epistle. To each and to all such
      inquiries I have, alas! been compelled to return the humiliating reply
      that I have not yet succeeded in finding out what was the origin of the
      family joke which made Goldsmith's allusions to &ldquo;The Jessamy Bride&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Little Comedy&rdquo; intelligible to the &ldquo;Devonshire Crew&rdquo; of Hornecks and
      Reynoldses. I have searched volume after volume in the hope of having even
      the smallest ray of light thrown upon this matter, but I have met with no
      success. I began to feel, as every post brought me a sympathetic inquiry
      as to the origin of the pet name, that I should take the bold step of
      confessing my ignorance to the one gentleman who, I was confident, could
      enlighten it. &ldquo;If Dr. Brewer does not know why Mary Horneck was called
      'The Jessamy Bride,' no one alive can know it,&rdquo; was what I said to myself.
      Before I could write to Dr. Brewer the melancholy new's came of his death;
      and very shortly afterwards I got a letter from his daughter, Mrs. Brewer
      Hayman, in which she mentioned that her lamented father had been greatly
      interested in my story, and asked if I could tell her what was the meaning
      of the phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does certainly seem extraordinary that no biographer of Goldsmith, of
      Reynolds, or of Burke, should have thought it worth while writing a letter
      to the &ldquo;Jessamy Bride&rdquo; herself to ask her why she was so called by
      Goldsmith. The biographers of Goldsmith and the editors of Boswell seem to
      have had no hesitation in stating that Mary Horneck was the &ldquo;Jessamy
      Bride,&rdquo; and that her elder sister was &ldquo;Little Comedy&rdquo;; but they do not
      appear to have taken a wider view of their duties than was comprised in
      this bare statement. The gossipy Northcote was surely in the secret, and
      he might have revealed the truth without detracting from the interest of
      the many inaccuracies in his volume. Northcote had an opportunity of
      seeing daily the portrait of Mary which Sir Joshua painted, and which hung
      in his studio until the day of his death, when it passed into the
      possession of the original, who had become Mrs. Gwyn, having married
      Colonel, afterwards General, Gwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although up to the present I have not obtained even as much evidence
      as would be termed a clue by the sanguine officers of Scotland Yard, as to
      the origin of the sobriquet, I am not without hope that some day one of my
      sympathetic correspondents will be able to clear up the matter for me. I
      am strengthened in this hope by the fact that among those who were kind
      enough to write to me, was a lady who can claim relationship to Mary
      Horneck, and who did not hesitate to send to me a bundle of letters,
      written in the early part of the century by the &ldquo;Jessamy Bride&rdquo; herself,
      with permission to copy and print any portion of the correspondence that I
      might consider of interest. Of this privilege I gladly avail myself,
      feeling sure that the interest which undoubtedly attaches to many portions
      of the letters will exculpate me for the intrusion of a personal note into
      these papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandfather of my correspondent (Mrs. Cor-ballis, of Ratrath, co.
      Meath, Ireland) was first cousin to the Hornecks. He was the Rev. George
      Mangles, chaplain to George III when Mrs. Gwyn (Mary Horneck) was Woman of
      the Bedchamber to the Queen. As General Gwyn was Equerry to the King it
      can easily be understood that the two families should be on terms of the
      most intimate friendship. My correspondent mentions that her mother, who
      only died thirteen years ago, was almost every year a visitor at the house
      of Mrs. Gwyn, at Kew, and said that she retained her beauty up to the very
      last. Confirmation of this statement is to be found in a passage in the
      &ldquo;Jerningham Letters.&rdquo; Lady Bedingfeld's Journal contains the following
      entry opposite the date &ldquo;September 19th, 1833&rdquo;:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the Queen returned to the drawing-room we found several ladies
      there. I observed a very old lady with striking remains of beauty, and
      whose features seemed very familiar to me. I felt to know her features by
      heart, and at last I heard her name, Mrs. Gwyn, the widow of a General,
      and near ninety! I had never seen her before, but when I was a girl my
      uncle the Poet, gave me a portrait of her, copied from Sir Jos. Reynolds,
      small size in a Turkish costume and attitude. This picture is still at
      Cossey, and of course must be very like her since it led me to find her
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0261.jpg" alt="0261 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0261.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The picture referred to must certainly have been &ldquo;very like&rdquo; the original,
      for it was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1772, sixty-one years before.
      The engraving of it cannot but make one feel how exquisite must have been
      the charm of Goldsmith's young friend, who survived him by sixty-six
      years; for Mrs. Gywn did not die until 1840.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very pathetic indeed it is to look at the sweet girlish face, which
      appears in this portrait and also in that of the two sisters done in chalk
      by the same master-hand, and then to read some of the passages in the
      letters in which the writer refers to her old age and feebleness. Happily,
      with Lady Bedingfeld's diary before us, our imagination is not largely
      drawn on for a picture of the &ldquo;Jessamy Bride&rdquo; broken down by age and
      infirmity. The woman who can be easily recognised by a stranger at
      seventy-nine by her likeness to a portrait painted at the age of eighteen,
      would make Ninon de l'Enclos envious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters are written to Mrs. Mangles, the widow of the Chaplain to
      George III, and the majority touch upon private matters with
      sprightliness, and occasionally a delicate humour, such as Goldsmith would
      certainly have appreciated. We seem to hear, while reading these passages,
      faint echoes of the girlish laughter which must have rung through that
      room in the inn at Calais, when Goldsmith paced up and down in a mock fury
      because two officers passing the window looked more eagerly at the girls
      than at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is obvious, however, that the Queen's Woman of the Bedchamber would
      write occasionally to her friend on some topic of public interest;
      consequently we find, in the course of the correspondence, many passages
      which throw a flood of light upon the incidents of the day. In a letter
      dated April 10th, 1818,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gwyn describes with great sprightliness the wedding of the Princess
      Elizabeth, the third daughter of George III, with Prince Hesse-Hombourgh,
      which took place three days before:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I delayed to write till after the marriage to tell you about it, as you
      seemed to wish it. We were all appointed at seven o'clock in the evening,
      when I went as smart as I could make myself. I wore the lavender sattin
      robe, the same you saw me wear at Court, as the shape was the same, and it
      <i>saved buying</i>, trimmed with silver, a new white sattin petticoat,
      with a white net and silver over it, no hoop, but a Court head dress, and
      lappets down. The Company consisting of the great officers of state, and
      ambassadors and their wives, and the different households were the
      Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At 8 all were assembled when the Royal family in procession according to
      their rank, went into the great drawing-room in the Queen's house. The
      Duke of York led the Queen, the Prince Regent not being quite recovered of
      his gout, and it is said the remembrance of his poor daughter's marriage
      was too painful to him to undertake it. Before the state canopy was set a
      fine communion table, red velvet and gold, all the gold plate belonging to
      that service arranged behind it, and 3 Bishops and other clergymen
      standing behind the table, it looked very magnificent. Then came the <i>Hero</i>,
      the Prince Hesse Hombourgh, he went up to the table and stood there, I
      believe 10 minutes alone, he looked well a manly unembarassed figure, then
      walked in the Bride glittering with silver and diamonds, and really looked
      very handsome, and her behaviour and manner was as well as possible, grace
      and quiet, when she knelt she wept, and then he approached nearer her in
      case her emotion would require his care, which happily was not the case.
      The Duke of York gave her away, and behaved very bad. The Prince Hombourgh
      thought when he had said I will very loud and distinct, all was done, but
      the Arch Bishop desired him to repeat after him, which he was therefore
      obliged to do. He cannot speak English and made such works of it, it was
      then the Duke of York laughed so, he was obliged to stuff his handkerchief
      in his mouth to conceal it. He promised to love her. When all was over he
      saluted his bride on each side the face, and then her hand, with a
      good-natured frank manner, then led her to the Queen, whose hand only he
      kissed, the rest of the Royal family he embraced after his own fashion,
      and he led her off with a very good air, and did not seem to trouble his
      head about his <i>English performance</i>.&rdquo; The Princess Elizabeth&mdash;the
      shy young bride who was so overcome with emotion&mdash;had scarcely more
      than passed her forty-ninth year when she was borne to the altar, and the
      hero of the hour was, we learn from other sources than Mrs. Gwyn's
      letters, most unheroically sick when driving away in a close carriage with
      his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince Regent's daughter, the Princess Charlotte, had died the
      previous year, hence the marrying panic which seized all the other members
      of the Royal Family, lest the dynasty should become extinct. It is
      pleasing to reflect that such gloomy apprehensions have since been amply
      averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the death of the Princess Charlotte Mrs. Gwyn writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... While I was at Oatlands the Prince Leopold came to see the Duchess
      and staid there 3 hours, no one but the Duchess saw him&mdash;she told me
      he is more composed in his manners now when seen by people in general but
      with her alone his grief seems the same and he is gratified by being
      allowed to vent it to one who feels for him and knows how to soothe his
      mind. I can not doubt the Princess's life and his child's were thrown
      away, by mismanagement&mdash;she was so bled and starved she had no
      strength left&mdash;her own fortitude and energy supported her till nature
      could no more. I could tell you much on the subject but it would take up
      too much in a letter and besides <i>it is over</i>. Dr. Crofts thought he
      was doing for the best no doubt&mdash;It comes to what <i>I</i> always say
      of them&mdash;they can't do much and are very often wrong in their
      opinions as you can vouch....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another letter Mrs. Gywn's adopted daughter was her amanuensis. It
      contains many paragraphs of interest, especially to present-day readers.
      The girl writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma was of course summoned to attend the Duke of Cambridge's Wedding,
      but she was not in the room when the Ceremony was performed as before, on
      account of the Queen having been ill. Mamma admires the Duchess of
      Cambridge very much: though she is not exactly handsome, she is very
      pleasing, and a pretty figure, but I understand she must have a new stay
      maker to set her up etc. The Duke of Kent and his bride are now expected.
      The Duke of Clarence it is expected will be married shortly afterwards. We
      hear the Duchess of Kent is a little woman with a handsome face, and the
      Duchess of Clarence uncommonly ugly. We went to Windsor about a month ago
      to see Princess Sophia as the Queen was not there, and Princess Sophia has
      a small party every night. We were there three days, and Mamma went to the
      party every evening, and indeed it was very very dull for her as they play
      one pool of Commerce, and then they go to a game called Snip, Snap,
      Snorum, and which Mamma could not play at well without a great deal of
      trouble to herself, therefore she was obliged to look on for perhaps an
      hour and half which you may imagine was terrible for her not hearing a
      word. I was much pleased in one respect while I was there by seeing Dear
      Prince Leopold whom I had never seen before, and who must be to every body
      an object of so much interest. He looked to me the picture of grief and
      melancholy, but those who have seen him repeatedly since his misfortune
      say he improves every time they see him. Mrs. C.... went one day to see
      Claremont and was very much pleased. All remains as Princess Charlotte
      left it, but nobody sees her room in which she died but himself, even her
      combs and brushes are untouched, and her hat and cloak are where she laid
      them the day before she died. There are models of her hand and arm one in
      particular as it is his hand clasped in hers. I suppose you have often
      heard she had a very beautiful hand and arm, but I will not go on, on so
      melancholy a subject; yet I am sure it must interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Sophia, who instituted the fascinating game referred to in
      this letter, was, of course, the fifth daughter of George III.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another letter reference is made to a certain scandal, which Mrs. Gwyn
      contradicts most vehemently. Even nowadays this particular bit of gossip
      is remembered by some persons; but at the risk of depriving these pages of
      the piquancy which attaches to a Court scandal, I will not quote it, but
      conclude this Personal Note with what seems to me a most pathetic account
      of the dying king:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We continue in a state of great anxiety about our dear King, whose state
      is distressing. Certainly no hope of recovery, and the chances of his
      continuance very doubtful. His death may be any day, any hour, or he may
      continue some <i>little</i> time longer, it depends on nature holding out
      against sore disease, which afflicts him universally, and occasions great
      suffering, this is heartbreaking to hear! and his patience and courage and
      sweet and kind behaviour to all about him is most touching, so
      affectionate to his friends and attendants, and thankful for their
      attention and feeling for him. He will hold the hand of the Duchess of
      Gloster or S. H. Halford for an hour at a time out of tenderness, till
      excessive suffering ends it. He wishes to die in peace and charity with
      all the world, and has reconciled himself to the Duke of Sussex. He hopes
      his people have found him a merciful King. He says he never hurt anyone,
      and that, he may truly say as his first wish to <i>all</i> was good and
      benevolent, and ever ready to forgive.&rdquo;

      THE AMAZING ELOPEMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N a certain
      evening in March, 1772, the fashionable folk of Bath were as earnestly on
      pleasure bent as they were wont to be at this season&mdash;and every
      other. The Assembly Rooms were open, a performance was going on at the
      theatre, the Cave of Harmony was as musical as Pyrrha's Grotto, a
      high-class concert was taking place under the conductorship of the
      well-known Mr. Linley, and the Countess of Huntingdon was holding a prayer
      meeting. For people who took their diversions <i>à la carte</i>, there was
      a varied and an abundant menu. Chairs containing precious structures of
      feathers, lace, and jewels towering over long faces powdered and patched
      and painted <i>à la mode</i>, were swinging along the streets in every
      direction, some with a brace of gold-braided lackeys by each of the
      windows, but others in charge only of the burly chairmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unobtrusive among the latter class of conveyance was one that a young
      gentleman, a tall and handsome lad, called from its rank between
      Pierrepont Street and the South Parade. He gave the bearers instructions
      to hasten to the house of Mr. Linley in the Crescent, and to inquire if
      Miss Linley were ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she were not, he told them that they were to wait for her and carry out
      her directions. The fellows touched their hats and swung off with their
      empty chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man then went to a livery stable, and putting a few confidential
      inquiries to the proprietor, received a few confidential replies,
      accentuated by a wink or two, and a certain quick uplifting of a knuckly
      forefinger that had an expression of secretiveness of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mum's the word, sir, and mum it shall be,&rdquo; whispered the man. &ldquo;I stowed
      away the trunk, leaving plenty of room for the genuine luggage&mdash;lady's
      luggage, Mr. Sheridan. You know as well as I can tell you, sir, being
      young but with as shrewd knowingness of affairs in general as might be
      looked for in the son of Tom Sheridan, to say nought of a lady like your
      mother, meaning to take no liberty in the world, Mr. Dick, as they call
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm obliged to you, Denham, and I'll not forget you when this little
      affair is happily over. The turn by the 'Bear' on the London Road, we
      agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there you'll find the chaise, sir, and as good a pair as ever left my
      stable, and good luck to you, sir!&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Sheridan then hastened to his father's house in King's Mead
      Street, and was met by an anxious sister in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news, I hope, Dick?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting for you all the evening. She has not changed her
      mind, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is as steadfast as I am,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If I could not swear that she
      would be steadfast, I would not undertake this business on her behalf.
      When I think of our father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think of him except as applauding your action,&rdquo; said the girl.
      &ldquo;Surely every one with the least spark of generosity will applaud your
      action, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't like to say so much,&rdquo; said Dick, shaking his head. &ldquo;Mathews
      has his friends. No man could know so much about whist as he does without
      having many friends, even though he be a contemptible scoundrel when he is
      not employed over a rubber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will dare to take the part of Mr. Mathews against you, Dick?&rdquo; cried
      his sister, looking at him proudly as the parlour candles shone upon him.
      &ldquo;I would that I could go with you as far as London, dear, but that would
      be impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite impossible; and where would be the merit in the end?&rdquo; said Dick,
      pacing the room as he believed a man of adventure and enterprise would in
      the circumstances. &ldquo;You may trust to me to place her in safety without the
      help of any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Dick, I know it, dear, and I am proud of you,&rdquo; said she,
      putting her arms about his neck and kissing him. &ldquo;And look you here,
      Dick,&rdquo; she added, in a more practical tone. &ldquo;Look you here&mdash;I find
      that I can spare another five pounds out of the last bill that came from
      Ireland. We shall live modestly in this house until you return to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the coins which she offered to him wrapped up in a twist of
      newspaper; but he showed some hesitation&mdash;she had to go through a
      form of forcing it upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to bring it back to you unbroken,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;but in affairs of
      this sort it is safest to have a pound or two over, rather than under,
      what is barely needful. That is why I take your coins,&mdash;a loan&mdash;a
      sacred loan. Good-bye, I returned only to say good-bye to you, my dearest
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew your good heart, Dick, that was why I was waiting for you.
      Good-bye, Dick, and God bless you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was putting on his cloak in the hall. He saw that the pistols were in
      its pockets, and then he suffered his sister to give him another kiss
      before he passed into the dark street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt for his pistols, and with a hand on each he felt that he was
      indeed fairly launched upon a great adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way to the London road, and all the time he was wondering if
      the girl would really come to him in the Sedan chair which he had sent for
      her. To be sure she had promised to come upon this evening, but he knew
      enough of the great affairs of this world to be well aware of the fact
      that the sincerest promise of a maid may be rendered worthless by the
      merest freak of Fate. Therefore, he knew that he did well to be doubtful
      respecting the realisation of her promise. She was the beautiful Miss
      Linley&mdash;every one in Bath knew her, and this being so, was it not
      likely that some one&mdash;some prying person&mdash;some impudent fellow
      like that Mathews who had been making love to her, although he had a wife
      of his own in Wales&mdash;might catch a glimpse of her face through the
      glass of the chair when passing a lamp or a link, and be sufficiently
      curious to follow her chair to see whither she was going?
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a likely enough thing to happen, and if it did happen and the
      alarm of his flight with her were given, what chance would he have of
      carrying out his purpose? Why, the chaise would be followed, and even if
      it was not overtaken before London was reached, the resting-place of the
      fugitives would certainly be discovered in London, and they should be
      ignominiously brought back to Bath. Yes, unless Mathews were the pursuer,
      in which case&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richard Brinsley Sheridan grasped more firmly the butt of the pistol
      in the right-hand pocket of his cloak. He felt at that moment that should
      Mathews overtake them, the going back to Bath would be on the part only of
      Mathews.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how would it be if Mr. Linley had become apprised of his daughter's
      intention to fly from Bath? He knew very well that Mr. Linley had the best
      of reasons for objecting to his daughter's leaving Bath. Mr. Linley's
      income was increased by several hundred pounds by reason of the payments
      made to him on account of his daughter's singing in public, and he was&mdash;very
      properly, considering his large family&mdash;fond of money. Before he had
      to provide for his family, he took good care that his family&mdash;his
      eldest daughter particularly&mdash;helped to provide for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless these eventualities were suggested to him&mdash;for young Mr.
      Sheridan was not without imagination&mdash;while on his way through the
      dark outskirts of the beautiful city to the London Road. The Bear Inn was
      just beyond the last of the houses. It stood at the junction of the London
      Road and a narrower one leading past a couple of farms. It was here that
      he had given instructions for the chaise to wait for him, and here he
      meant to wait for the young lady who had promised to accompany him to
      London&mdash;and further.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the chaise without trouble. It was under the trees not more than
      a hundred yards down the lane, but the chair, with Miss Linley, had not
      yet arrived, so he returned to the road and began to retrace his steps,
      hoping to meet it, yet with some doubts in his mind. Of course, he was
      impatient. Young gentlemen under twenty-one are usually impatient when
      awaiting the arrival of the ladies who have promised to run away with
      them. He was not, however, kept in suspense for an unconscionably long
      time. He met the chair which he was expecting just when he had reached the
      last of the lamps of Bath, and out of it stepped the muffled form of Miss
      Linley. The chairmen were paid with a lavish hand, and Dick Sheridan and
      Betsy Linley walked on to the chaise without exchanging any but a friendly
      greeting&mdash;there was nothing lover-like in their meeting or their
      greeting. The elopement was not that of a young woman with her lover; it
      was, we are assured, that of a young woman anxious to escape from the
      intolerable position of being the most popular person in the most
      fashionable city in England, to the peaceful retreat of a convent; and the
      young man who was to take charge of her was one whom she had chosen for
      her guardian, not for her lover. Dick Sheridan seems to have been the only
      young man in Bath who had never made love to Elizabeth Linley. His elder
      brother, Charles by name, had discharged this duty on behalf of the
      Sheridan family, and he was now trying to live down his disappointment at
      being refused, at a farmhouse a mile or two away. The burden was greater
      than he could bear when surrounded by his sisters in their father's house
      in King's Mead Street.

    <p>
      Elizabeth Linley was certainly the most popular young woman in Bath; she
      certainly was the most beautiful. The greatest painters of her day made
      masterpieces of her portrait, and for once, posterity acknowledges that
      the fame of her beauty was well founded. So spiritual a face as hers is to
      be seen in no eighteenth-century picture except that of Miss Linley; one
      has need to go back to the early Italian painters to find such
      spirituality in a human face, and then one finds it combined with absolute
      inanity, and the face is called Divine. Reynolds painted her as Saint
      Cecilia drawing down angels, and blessedly unconscious of her own powers,
      thinking only of raising herself among angels on the wings of song. His
      genius was never better employed and surely never more apparent than in
      the achievement of this picture. Gainsborough painted her by the side of
      her younger brother, and one feels that if Reynolds painted a saint,
      Gainsborough painted a girl. It was Bishop O'Beirne, an old friend of her
      family and acquainted with her since her childhood, who said: &ldquo;She is a
      link between an angel and a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this exquisite creature had a voice of so sympathetic a quality that
      no one could hear it unmoved. Her father had made her technique perfect.
      He was a musician who was something more than painstaking. He had taste of
      the highest order, and it is possible to believe that in the training of
      his eldest daughter he was wise enough to limit his instruction to the
      technicalities of his art, leaving her to the inspiration of her own
      genius in regard to the treatment of any theme which he brought before
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate her success in the sublimest of all oratorios was far beyond
      anything that could be achieved by an exhibition of the finest technical
      qualities; and Mr. Linley soon became aware of the fact that he was the
      father of the most beautiful and the most highly gifted creature that ever
      made a father miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incidentally she made a great many other men miserable, but that was only
      because each of them wanted her to make him happy at the expense of the
      others, and this she was too kind-hearted to do. But the cause of her
      father's grief was something different. It was due to the fact that the
      girl was so sensitive that she shrank from every exhibition of herself and
      her ability on a public platform. It was an agony to her to hear the
      tumultuous applause that greeted her singing at a concert or in an
      oratorio. She seemed to feel&mdash;let any one look at the face which is
      to be seen in her portrait, and one will understand how this could be&mdash;that
      music was something too spiritual to be made the medium only for the
      entertainment of the multitude. Taking the highest imaginable view of the
      scope and value and meaning of music, it can be understood that this girl
      should shrink from such an ordeal as the concert platform offered to her
      every time she was announced to sing. No more frivolous and fashionable a
      population than that of Bath in the second half of the eighteenth century
      was to be found in any city in the world; and Elizabeth Linley felt that
      she was regarded by the concert-goers as no more than one of the numerous
      agents they employed to lessen the ennui of an empty day. The music which
      she worshipped&mdash;the spirit with which her soul communed in secret&mdash;was,
      she felt, degraded by being sold to the crowd and subjected to the
      patronage of their applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course when she spoke to her father in this strain he sympathised with
      her, and bemoaned the fate that made it necessary for him to have her
      assistance to save her mother and brothers and sisters from starvation.
      And so for several years she was an obedient child, but very weary of the
      rôle. She sang and enchanted thousands. She did not, however, think of
      them; her mind dwelt daily upon the tens of thousands who regarded her
      (she thought) as fulfilling no nobler purpose than to divert them for half
      an hour between taking the waters and sitting down to faro or quadrille.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not alone her distaste for the publicity of the platform that
      made her miserable. The fact was that she was distracted by suitors. She
      had, it was said, accepted the offer of an elderly gentleman named Long,
      the wealthy head of a county family in the neighbourhood; and Foote, with
      his usual vulgarity, which took the form of personality, wrote a play&mdash;a
      wretched thing even for Foote&mdash;in which he dealt with an imaginarily
      comic and a certainly sordid situation, with Miss Linley on the one side
      and Mr. Long on the other. Serious biographers have not hesitated to
      accept this situation invented by the notorious <i>farceur</i>, who was no
      greater a respecter of persons than he was of truth, as a valuable
      contribution to the history of the Linley family, especially in regard to
      the love affair of the lovely girl by whose help they were made famous.
      They have never thought of the possibility of her having accepted Mr. Long
      in order to escape from her horror of the concert platform. They have
      never suggested the possibility of Mr. Long's settling a sum of money on
      her out of his generosity when he found out that Miss Linley did not love
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not Mr. Long, however, but a man named Mathews&mdash;sometimes
      referred to as Captain, occasionally as Major&mdash;who was the immediate
      cause of her running away with young Sheridan. This man Mathews was known
      to be married, and to be in love with Elizabeth Linley, and yet he was
      allowed to be constantly in her company, pestering her with his
      attentions, and there was no one handy to horsewhip him. Sheridan's
      sister, who afterwards married Mr. Lefanu, wrote an account of this
      curious matter for the guidance of Thomas Moore, who was preparing his
      biography of her brother. She stated that Miss Linley was afraid to tell
      her father of Major Mathews and his impossible suit, and so she was &ldquo;at
      length induced to consult Richard Sheridan, whose intimacy with Major
      Mathews, at the time, she thought might warrant his interference.&rdquo; And
      then we are told that &ldquo;R. B. Sheridan sounded Mathews on the subject and
      at length prevailed on him to give up the pursuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is how the adoring sister of &ldquo;R. B. Sheridan,&rdquo; who had been talking
      to Elizabeth Linley of him as of a knight-errant, eager to redress the
      wrongs of maidens in distress, wrote of her brother! He &ldquo;sounded Mathews
      on the subject.&rdquo; On what subject? The subject was the pursuit of an
      innocent girl by a contemptible scoundrel. How does the knight-errant
      &ldquo;sound&rdquo; such a person when he sets out to redress the maiden's
      ill-treatment? One R. B. Sheridan, a dramatist, gives us a suggestion as
      to what were his ideas on this point: &ldquo;Do you think that Achilles or my
      little Alexander the Great ever enquired where the right lay? No, sir,
      they drew their broadswords and left the lazy sons of peace to settle the
      rights of the matter.&rdquo; Now young Sheridan, who is reported by his sister
      as &ldquo;sounding&rdquo; Mathews, was no coward. He proved himself to be anything but
      afraid of Mathews, so that one must, out of justice to him, assume that
      the only attempt he would have made to &ldquo;sound&rdquo; the scoundrel at this time
      would be through the medium of a sound hiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at such a point as this in the biography of an interesting man that
      one blesses the memory&mdash;and the notebook&mdash;of the faithful
      Boswell. Thomas Moore was quite intimate with Richard Brinsley Sheridan,
      but he never thought of asking him for some information on this particular
      incident in his life, the fact being that he had no definite intention of
      becoming his biographer. We know perfectly well how Boswell would have
      plied Johnson with questions on the subject, had it ever come to his ears
      that Johnson had undertaken to play the rôle of a knight-errant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, sir, what did you say to Mathews when you sounded him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, sir, that in any circumstances a married gentleman who is
      showing marked attentions to a virtuous young lady should be sounded by a
      young gentleman who has been entrusted with the duty of protecting the
      lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! instead of the unblushing indelicacy of Boswell, who hunted for
      trifles as a pig hunts for truffles, we are obliged to be content with the
      vagueness of a sister, whose memory, we have an uneasy feeling, was not
      quite so good as she thought it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from the memory of this sister we have an account of the amazing
      elopement of Richard Sheridan with Elizabeth Linley.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young gentleman put her into the chaise that was waiting for them
      on the London road, Miss Linley had never thought of him except as a kind
      friend. She had accepted his services upon this occasion as she would
      those of a courier to conduct her to London, and thence to France, where
      she intended to enter a convent. The Miss Sheridans had lived in France,
      and had some friends at St.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quentin, who knew of a very nice clean convent&mdash;an establishment
      which they could strongly recommend, and where she could find that
      complete seclusion which Miss Linley longed for, and their brother Dick
      was thought to be a very suitable companion for her on her way thither.
      Mrs. Lefanu (<i>née</i> Sheridan), who wrote out the whole story in after
      years, mentioned that her chivalrous brother was to provide a woman to act
      as her maid in the chaise; but as not the least reference to this chaperon
      is to be found in the rest of the story, we fear that it must be assumed
      either that her brother forgot this unimportant detail, or that the detail
      was unavoidably detained in Bath. What is most likely of all is that the
      solitary reference to this mysterious female was dovetailed, somewhat
      clumsily, into the narrative, at the suggestion of some Mrs. Grundy, who
      shook her head at the narrative of so much chivalry unsupported by a
      responsible chaperon. However this may be, the shadowy chaperon is never
      alluded to again; she may have faded away into the mists of morning and
      London, or she may have vanished at the first turnpike. Nothing was seen
      or heard of her subsequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy and the girl reached London in safety, and drove to the house of a
      Mr. Ewart, a relation of the Sheridans, to whom Dick offered the
      explanation of his unconventional visit on the very plausible grounds of
      his being engaged to the young lady, a great heiress, whom he was
      hastening to France to marry. Of course the Ewart family were perfectly
      satisfied with this explanation; and another friend, who had indisputable
      claims to consideration, being, we are told, &ldquo;the son of a respectable
      brandy merchant in the City,&rdquo; suggested that they should sail from London
      to Dunkirk, &ldquo;in order to make pursuit more difficult.&rdquo; How such an end
      could be compassed by such means is left to the imagination of a reader.
      The young pair, however, jumped at the suggestion, and reached Dunkirk
      after an uneventful crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at this point in the sister's account of the itinerary of this
      interesting enterprise that she mentions that Richard suddenly threw away
      the disguise of the chivalrous and disinterested protector of the young
      lady, and declared that he would not consent to conduct her to the convent
      unless she agreed to marry him immediately. Mrs. Lefanu's exact words are
      as follows: &ldquo;After quitting Dunkirk Mr. Sheridan was more explicit with
      Miss Linley as to his views on accompanying her to France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is certainly a very lawyer-like way of condoning the conduct of a
      mean scoundrel; but, happily for the credit of Richard Brinsley Sheridan,
      it is the easiest thing in the world to discredit his sister's narrative,
      although she adds that he urged on the girl what would seem to a casual
      observer of society in general to be perfectly true&mdash;&ldquo;she must be
      aware that after the step she had taken, she could not appear in England
      but as his wife.&rdquo; As the sequel proved this alleged statement was quite
      untrue! She did appear in England, and not as his wife, and no one seemed
      to think anything the worse of her on account of her escapade. But to
      suggest that Sheridan took advantage of the trust which the innocent girl
      had reposed in him to compel her to marry him, a penniless minor with no
      profession and very little education, is scarcely consistent with an
      account of his high-mindedness and his sense of what was chivalrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the sister pleasantly remarks that &ldquo;Miss Linley, who really
      preferred him greatly to any person, was not difficult to persuade, and at
      a village not far from Calais the marriage ceremony was performed by a
      priest who was known to be often employed upon such occasions.&rdquo; Whoever
      this clergyman may have been, it is impossible for any one to believe that
      in the discharge of his office he was kept in constant employment; for
      &ldquo;such occasions&rdquo; as answered to the account given by the Sheridan sister
      of the nuptials of the young couple, must have been extremely rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet Moore, on whom the responsibilities of a biographer rested very
      lightly, was quite content to accept as strictly accurate the narrative of
      Mrs. Lefanu, contradicted though it was by subsequent events in which both
      her brother and Miss Linley were concerned. Moore does not seem to have
      troubled himself over any attempt to obtain confirmation of one of the
      most important incidents in the life of the man of whom he was writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no attempt to discover if the accommodating priest at the village
      near Calais was still alive when he was compiling his biography of
      Sheridan, and it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that he was
      still alive; nor did this easy-going Irish master of melodies consider
      that it devolved on him to try to find some record of the marriage in
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what happened after this remarkable union? The narrative of the sister
      is quite as circumstantial as one could wish it to be, and even more
      imaginative. But whatever qualities of excellence it possesses, it
      certainly does not carry to a reader any conviction of accuracy. It states
      that the interesting young couple went to Lille instead of carrying out
      their original intention of going to St. Quentin, and that Miss Linley&mdash;now
      Mrs. Sheridan, of course&mdash;&ldquo;immediately secured an apartment in a
      convent, where it was settled she was to remain either till Sheridan came
      of age or till he was in a situation to support a wife. He remained a few
      days at Lille to be satisfied that she was settled to her satisfaction;
      but, whether from agitation of mind or fatigue, she was taken ill, and an
      English physician, Dr. Dolman, of York, was called in to attend her. From
      what he perceived of her case he wished to have her more immediately under
      his care than he could in the convent, and he and Mrs. Dolman most kindly
      invited her to their house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This would seem to have been very kind indeed on the part of the doctor
      and his wife, but it so happened that a letter turned up some years ago
      which the late Mr. Fraser Rae was able to print in the first volume of his
      admirable <i>Life of Sheridan</i>, and this letter makes it plain that
      wherever Mrs. Sheridan (<i>née</i> Linley) may have been, she was not
      sojourning with the Dolmans. It is from Dr. Dolman himself, and it was
      addressed to &ldquo;Monsieur Sherridan, Gentilhomme Anglois, à l'Hôtel de
      Bourbon, Sur la Grande Place.&rdquo; It recommends the administering of certain
      powders in a glass of white wine twice daily, and sends &ldquo;compliments and
      wishes of health to your lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question then remains: Was the lady at this time an inmate of the
      convent, and did the doctor expect &ldquo;Monsieur Sherridan&rdquo; to go to this
      institution twice a day in order to administer the powders to his lady?
      Would not the doctor think it somewhat peculiar that the husband should be
      at the Hôtel de Bourbon and his lady an inmate of the convent?
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions must be left to be answered according to the experience of
      life of any one interested in the matter. But it is worth noticing that,
      on the very day that he received the missive from Dr. Dolman, Sheridan
      wrote to his brother at Bath and mentioned that Miss Linley&mdash;he
      continued to call her Miss Linley&mdash;was now &ldquo;fixing in a convent,
      where she has been entered some time.&rdquo; Does the first phrase mean that she
      was already in the convent, or only about to take up her residence there?
      However this question may be answered, it is clear that Sheridan expected
      to leave her behind him at Lille, for he adds, &ldquo;Everything is now so
      happily settled here I will delay no longer giving you that information,
      though probably I shall set out for England without knowing a syllable of
      what has happened with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far, then, as his emprise in regard to the lady was concerned, he
      considered the incident to be closed. &ldquo;Though you may have been ignorant
      for some time of our proceedings, you could never have been uneasy,&rdquo; he
      continues hopefully, &ldquo;lest anything should tempt me to depart, even in a
      thought, from the honour and consistency which engaged me at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some people have suggested that Sheridan, when he drew the character of
      Charles Surface, meant it to be something of an excuse for his own casual
      way of life. But it must strike a good many persons who believe that he
      induced the innocent girl, whom he set forth to protect on her way to a
      refuge from the infamous designs of Mathews, to marry him, that Sheridan
      approached much more closely to the character of Joseph in this
      correspondence with his brother. A more hypocritical passage than that
      just quoted could hardly have been uttered by Joseph Surface. As a matter
      of fact, one of Joseph's sentiments is only a paraphrase of this unctuous
      assumption of honour and consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this criticism is only true if one can believe his sister's story of
      the marriage. If it is true that Sheridan set out from England with Miss
      Linley with the intention of so compromising her that she should be
      compelled to marry him, at the same time pretending to her and to his
      brother to be actuated by the highest motives in respect of the ill-used
      girl, it is impossible to think of him except with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily the weight of evidence is overpoweringly in Sheridan's favour. We
      may think of him as a rash, an inconsiderate, and a culpably careless boy
      to take it upon him to be the girl's companion to the French convent, but
      we refuse to believe that he was ever capable of acting the grossly
      disingenuous part attributed to him by his sister, and accepted without
      question by his melodious biographer. There are many people, however, who
      believe that when a man marries a woman, no matter in what circumstances,
      he has &ldquo;acted the part of a gentleman&rdquo; in regard to her, and must be held
      to be beyond reproach on any account whatsoever so far as the woman is
      concerned. In the eyes of such censors of morality, as in the eyes of the
      law, the act of marriage renders null and void all ante-nuptial deeds; and
      it was probably some impression of this type which was acquired by
      Sheridan's sister, inducing her to feel sure (after a time) that her
      brother's memory would suffer if his biographer were to tell the story of
      his inconsiderate conduct in running away with Elizabeth Linley, unless it
      was made clear that he married her the first moment he had to spare. She
      tried to save her brother's memory by persuading her own to accommodate
      itself to what she believed to be her brother's emergency. She was a good
      sister, and she kept her memory well under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did the father of the young lady think of the matter? What did
      the people of Bath, who were well acquainted with all the actors engaged
      in this little comedy, think of the matter? Happily these questions can be
      answered by appealing to facts rather than to the well-considered
      recollections of a discreet lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know for certain that Mr. Linley, who was, as one might suppose, fully
      equipped to play the part of the enraged father of the runaway girl,
      turned up at the place of her retreat&mdash;he had no trouble in learning
      in what direction to look for her&mdash;and having found her and the young
      gentleman who had run away with her, did he, under the impulse of his
      anger, fanned by his worldly knowledge, insist with an uplifted horsewhip
      upon his marrying her without a moment's delay? Mr. Linley knew Bath, and
      to know Bath was to know the world. Was he, then, of the same opinion as
      that expressed (according to his sister's narrative) by young Sheridan to
      persuade Miss Linley to be his bride&mdash;namely, that it would be
      impossible for her to show her face in Bath unless as the wife of Richard
      Brinsley Sheridan?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing of the sort. Whatever reproaches he may have flung at his
      daughter, however strong may have been his denunciation of the conduct of
      the man who had run away with her, they had not the effect either of
      inducing his daughter or her companion to reveal to him the fact that they
      had been married for several days, or of interrupting the friendly
      relations that had existed for nearly two years between himself and young
      Sheridan. The dutiful memory of Miss Sheridan records that Mr. Linley,
      &ldquo;after some private conversation with Mr. Sheridan, appeared quite
      reconciled to his daughter, but insisted on her returning to England with
      him (Mr. Linley) to fulfil several engagements he had entered into on her
      account. The whole party set out together the next day, Mr. Linley having
      previously promised to allow his daughter to return to Lille when her
      engagements were over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The comedy of the elopement had become a farce of the &ldquo;whimsical&rdquo; type.
      Nothing more amusing or amazing has ever been seen on the vaudeville
      stage. The boy and the girl run off together and get married. The
      infuriated father follows them, ruthlessly invades their place of refuge,
      and then, &ldquo;after some private conversation&rdquo; with his daughter's husband,
      who does not tell him that he is her husband, says to the young woman, &ldquo;My
      dear, you must come home with me to sing at a concert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, papa,&rdquo; replies the girl. &ldquo;Wait a minute, and I'll go too,&rdquo;
       cries the unconfused husband of the daughter. &ldquo;All right, come along,&rdquo;
       says the father, and they all take hands and sing the ridiculous trio
      which winds up the vaudeville after it has run on inconsequentially for a
      merry forty minutes&mdash;there is a <i>pas de trois</i>, and the curtain
      falls!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, for the difference between Boswell the bald and Moore the melodious!
      The bald prose of Boswell's diaries may have made many of the personages
      with whom he dealt seem silly, but that was because he himself was silly,
      and, being aware of this fact, the more discriminating of his readers have
      no great difficulty in arriving at the truth of any matter with which he
      deals. He would never have accepted unreservedly such a narrative as that
      which Moore received from Mrs. Lefanu (<i>née</i> Sheridan), and put into
      his own language, or as nearly into his own language as he could. But
      Moore found it &ldquo;so hard to narrate familiar events eloquently,&rdquo; he
      complained. He actually thought that Mrs. Lefanu's narrative erred on the
      side of plausibility! The mysterious elopement, the still more mysterious
      marriage, and the superlatively mysterious return of the fugitives and the
      irate father hand-in-hand, he regarded as events so commonplace as not to
      be susceptible of lyrical treatment. But the most farcical of the doings
      of his own <i>Fudge Family</i> were rational in comparison with the
      familiar events associated with the flight to France of his hero and
      heroine. The <i>Trip to Scarborough</i> of Sheridan the farce-writer was
      founded on much more &ldquo;familiar events&rdquo; than this extraordinary trip to
      Lille, as narrated for the benefit of the biographer by Mrs. Lefanu.
    </p>
    <p>
      What seems to be the truth of the whole matter is simply that Sheridan
      undertook to be a brother to Elizabeth Linley, and carried out his compact
      faithfully, without allowing anything to tempt him to depart, as he wrote
      to Charles, &ldquo;even in thought from the honour and consistency which engaged
      [him] at first.&rdquo; It must be remembered that he was a romantic boy of
      twenty, and this is just the age at which nearly every boy&mdash;especially
      a boy in love&mdash;is a Sir Galahad. As for Miss Linley, one has only to
      look at her portrait to know what she was. She was not merely innocent,
      she was innocence itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Linley appeared at Lille he accepted without reserve the
      explanation offered to him by his daughter and by Sheridan; and, moreover,
      he knew that although there was a school for scandal located at Bath, yet
      so highly was his daughter thought of in all circles, and so greatly was
      young Sheridan liked, that no voice of calumny would be raised against
      either of them when they returned with him. And even if it were possible
      that some whisper, with its illuminating smile above the arch of a painted
      fan, might be heard in the Assembly Rooms when some one mentioned the name
      of Miss Linley in connection with that of young Sheridan and with the trip
      to Lille, he felt convinced that such a whisper would be robbed of its
      sting when every one knew that the girl and the boy and the father all
      returned together and on the best terms to Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the events proved, he had every right to take even so sanguine a view
      of the limitations of the range of the Pump Room gossips. On the return of
      the three from Lille no one suggested that Sheridan and Miss Linley should
      get married. No one except the scoundrel Mathews suggested that Sheridan
      had acted badly or even unwisely, though undoubtedly he had given grounds
      for such implications. The little party returned to Bath, and Miss Linley
      fulfilled her concert and oratorio engagements, went into society as
      before, and had at her feet more eligible suitors than had ever knelt
      there. We have it on the authority of Charles Sheridan, the elder brother,
      that in Bath the feeling was that Richard had acted as a man of honour in
      taking the girl to the convent at Lille. Writing to their uncle, Mr.
      Chamberlaine, he expressed surprise that &ldquo;in this age when the world does
      not abound in Josephs, most people are (notwithstanding the general
      tendency of mankind to judge unfavourably) inclined to think that he
      (Richard) acted with the strictest honour in his late expedition with Miss
      L., when the circumstances might allow of their being very dubious on this
      head without incurring the imputation of being censorious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This testimony as to what was the opinion in Bath regarding the expedition
      is extremely valuable, coming as it does from one who was never greatly
      disposed to take a brotherly or even a friendly view of Richard's conduct
      at any time&mdash;coming as it does also from a man who had been in love
      with Miss Linley.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate this escapade of young Mr. Sheridan was the most fortunate for
      him of any in which he ever engaged, and he was a man of many escapades,
      for it caused Elizabeth Linley to fall in love with him, and never was a
      man beloved by a sweeter or more faithful woman. To know how beautiful was
      her nature one has only to look at her face in either of the great
      portraits of her which are before us to-day. No characteristic of all that
      is held to be good and gracious and sympathetic&mdash;in one word, that is
      held to be womanly, is absent from her face. No man that ever lived was
      worthy of such a woman; but if only men who are worthy of such women were
      beloved by them, mankind would be the losers. She loved Sheridan with the
      truest devotion&mdash;such devotion as might be expected from such a
      nature as hers&mdash;and she died in the act of writing to him the
      love-letter of a wife to her dearly loved husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not get married until a year after the date of their flight to
      the Continent, and then they were described as bachelor and spinster.
      Neither of them ever gave a hint, even in any of the numerous letters
      which they exchanged during this period, that they had gone through the
      ceremony of marriage at that village near Calais. More than once a
      strained situation would have been relieved had it been possible to make
      such a suggestion, for now and again each of the lovers grew jealous of
      the other for a day or two. But neither said, &ldquo;Pray remember that you are
      not free to think of marrying any one. We are husband and wife, although
      we were married in secret.&rdquo; Neither of them could make such an assertion.
      It would not have been true. What seems to us to be the truth is that it
      was Sir Galahad who acted as protector to his sister when Richard Brinsley
      Sheridan went with Elizabeth Linley to France.

      THE AMAZING DUELS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN young Mr.
      Sheridan returned to Bath after his happy little journey to France with
      Miss Linley and back with Mr. Linley, he may have believed that the
      incident was closed. He had done all that&mdash;and perhaps a little more
      than&mdash;the most chivalrous man of experience and means could be
      expected to do for the young woman toward whom he had stood in the
      position of a protecting brother. He had conducted her to the convent at
      Lille, on which she had set her heart, and he had been able to explain
      satisfactorily to her father on his arrival at the hotel where he and Miss
      Linley were sojourning in the meantime, what his intentions had been when
      he had eloped with her from Bath. No doubt he had also acted as Miss
      Linley's adviser in respect of those negotiations with her father which
      resulted in the happy return of the whole family party to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      In London he heard that Mathews, the scoundrel who had been pursuing Miss
      Linley in the most disreputable fashion, was in town also, and that,
      previous to leaving Bath, he had inserted in the Chronicle a defamatory
      advertisement regarding him (Sheridan); and on this information coming to
      his ears he put his pistols into his pocket and went in search of Mathews
      at the lodgings of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sheridan tells us about the pistols in the course of her lucid
      narrative, and states on her own responsibility that when he came upon
      Mathews the latter was dreadfully frightened at the sight of one of the
      pistols protruding from Sheridan's pocket. Mr. Fraser Rae, the competent
      biographer of Sheridan, smiles at the lady's statement. &ldquo;The sight of the
      pistols would have alarmed Sheridan's sisters,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but it is in
      accordance with probability that he (Mathews) expected a hostile meeting
      to follow as a matter of course. He must have been prepared for it, and he
      would have been strangely ignorant of the world in which he lived if he
      had deemed it unusual.&rdquo;

    <p>
      But Mr. Fraser Rae was not so strangely ignorant of the world in which
      Sheridan and Mathews lived as to fancy that there was nothing unusual in a
      gentleman's going to ask another gentleman whom he believed to have
      affronted him, for an explanation, with a pair of pistols in his pocket.
      In the circumstances a duel would have been nothing unusual; but surely
      Mr. Fraser Rae could not have fancied that Sheridan set out with the
      pistols in his pocket in order to fight a duel with Mathews in the man's
      lodgings, without preliminaries and without seconds. If Mathews caught
      sight of the butt of a pistol sticking out of Sheridan's pocket he had
      every reason to be as frightened as Miss Sheridan declared he was, for he
      must have believed that his visitor had come to murder him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, frightened or not frightened, pistols or no pistols, Mathews,
      on being interrogated by Sheridan as to the advertisement in the <i>Bath
      Chronicle</i>, assured him that he had been grossly misinformed as to the
      character of the advertisement. It was, he affirmed, nothing more than an
      inquiry after Sheridan, which the family of the latter had sanctioned. He
      then, according to Miss Sheridan, expressed the greatest friendship for
      his visitor, and said that he would be made extremely unhappy if any
      difference should arise between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So young Mr. Sheridan, balked of his murderous intentions, returned with
      unsullied pistols to his hotel, and set out for Bath with Miss Linley and
      her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he fancied that Mathews had passed out of his life he was quickly
      undeceived. Before he had time to take his seat at the family table he had
      got a copy of the newspaper containing the advertisement, of the tenor of
      which Mathews had told him in London he had been misinformed; and now his
      sisters made him fully aware of the action taken by the same man on
      learning of the flight of Sheridan and Elizabeth Linley. The result was
      that he now perceived what every one should have known long before&mdash;namely,
      that Mathews was a scoundrel, who should never have been allowed to obtain
      the footing to which he had been admitted in the Sheridan and Linley
      families.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that the moment Mathews heard that Miss Linley had been carried
      beyond his reach, he rushed to the Sheridans' house, and there found the
      girls and their elder brother, who had been wisely communicated with by
      the landlord, and had left his retirement in the farmhouse in the country
      to take charge of the sisters in the absence of their brother Richard.
      Mathews behaved like a madman&mdash;no unusual <i>rôle</i> for him&mdash;heaping
      reproaches upon the absent member of the family, and demanding to be told
      of his whereabouts. He seems to have been encouraged by Charles Sheridan,
      who had unwisely said something in disparagement of his brother. Mathews
      had the effrontery to avow his passion for Elizabeth Linley, and in the
      bitterest terms to accuse Richard Sheridan of having acted basely in
      taking her beyond his reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he hastened to Richard Sheridan's friend and confidant, a young man
      named Brereton, and to him he sent messages of friendship and, possibly,
      condolence to Mr. Linley, though his object in paying this visit was
      undoubtedly not to endeavour to exculpate himself as regards Mr. Linley,
      but to find out where the fugitives were to be found. He may have had
      visions of pursuing them, of fighting a duel with Richard Sheridan, and if
      he succeeded in killing him, of getting the girl at last into his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Brereton not only did not reveal the whereabouts of his friend&mdash;he
      knew that Sheridan meant to go to Lille, for he wrote to him there&mdash;but
      he also refused to give his interrogator any sympathy for having failed to
      accomplish the destruction of the girl. Brereton, indeed, seems to have
      convinced him that the best thing he could do was to leave Bath as quickly
      as possible. Mathews had probably by this time discovered, as Brereton
      certainly had, that the feeling against him in Bath was profound. There
      can be little doubt that in the course of the day Charles Sheridan became
      aware of this fact also; he had only a few months before confessed himself
      to be deeply in love with Elizabeth Linley, and when he heard that his
      brother had run away with her he could not but have been somewhat incensed
      against him, for Richard had not taken him into his confidence. By the
      time his brother returned, however, any ill-feeling that Charles may have
      felt had disappeared, and as Charles always showed himself to be a cool
      and calculating gentleman&mdash;one who always kept an eye on the jumping
      cat&mdash;it is not going too far to assume that his change of tone in
      respect of his rather impetuous brother was due to his perception of the
      trend of public opinion on the subject of the elopement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brereton had persuaded Mathews that there was nothing left for him but to
      quit Bath; but before taking this step the latter had inserted in the <i>Bath
      Chronicle</i> the advertisement of which Richard had heard, but which he
      had not read when in London, thus leaving himself in no position to
      contradict Mathews' assertion as to its amicable wording.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the newspaper was put into his hands by Charles, and he had an
      opportunity of pronouncing an opinion on this point. It was dated
      Wednesday, April the 8th, 1772, and it ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Richard S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; having attempted in a letter
      left behind him for that purpose, to account for his scandalous method of
      running away from this place by insinuations derogating from my character
      and that of a young lady, innocent as far as relates to me, or my
      knowledge, since which he has neither taken any notice of letters or even
      informed his own family of the place where he has hid himself; I cannot
      longer think he deserves the treatment of a gentleman, and in this public
      method, to post him as a L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and a treacherous S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as I am convinced there have been many malevolent incendiaries
      concerned in the propagation of this infamous lie, if any of them,
      unprotected by age, <i>infirmities</i>, or profession, they are to
      acknowledge the part they have acted, and affirm <i>to</i> what they have
      said <i>of</i> me, they may depend on receiving the proper reward of their
      villainy, in the most public manner. The world will be candid enough to
      judge properly (I make no doubt) of any private abuse on this subject for
      the future, as nobody can defend himself from an accusation he is ignorant
      of Thomas Mathews.&rdquo; Such a piece of maundering imbecility as this had
      probably never before appeared in a newspaper. It must have been read in
      Bath with roars of laughter. But we do not hear that any of the ready
      writers of the time and the town yielded to the temptation of commenting
      upon the &ldquo;malevolent incendiarism&rdquo; of the composition. A man of the world,
      had it been written about himself, would possibly have thought that its
      illiteracy spoke for itself, and so would have refrained from making any
      move in regard to it or its author. But one can imagine what effect
      reading it would have upon a boy of Sheridan's spirit. For a youth of
      twenty to find himself posted as a Liar and a Scoundrel, to say nothing of
      a &ldquo;malevolent incendiary,&rdquo; and remain indifferent would be impossible.
      Sheridan did not take long to make up his mind what he should do in the
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatic touch which his sister introduces in writing of Richard's
      perusal of the paragraph is intensely true to nature. He simply put a word
      or two to Charles relative to what Mathews had told him in London about
      his, Sheridan's, family sanctioning the insertion of the advertisement.
      Charles had no difficulty in vindicating his integrity on this point.
      Richard knew perfectly well that it is one thing to say that a man has
      acted too hastily, but quite another to suggest that that man is &ldquo;a L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      and a S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So apparently the matter ended, and Richard continued chatting with his
      sisters, giving no sign of what was in his mind. The girls went to their
      beds, suspecting nothing. The next morning their two brothers were
      missing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the girls were dreadfully alarmed. Some people in the house told
      them that they had heard high words being exchanged between the brothers
      after the girls had retired, and shortly afterwards the two former had
      gone out together. The sister, in her narrative, mentions that she
      received a hint or two of a duel between Richard and Charles, but she at
      once put these suggestions aside. The poor girls must have been nearly
      distracted. Certainly the house of Sheridan was passing through a period
      of great excitement. The estimable head of the family was himself
      expecting a crisis in his affairs as manager of the theatre in Dublin&mdash;Mr.
      Thomas Sheridan was never far removed from a crisis&mdash;and in his
      absence his young people were doing pretty much as they pleased. He had no
      power of controlling them; all that he had to do with them was to pay
      their bills. Neither of the sons was earning anything, and while one of
      them was living as a man of fashion, the other had thought it well to cut
      himself off from his sisters, taking lodgings at a farm some way out of
      Bath It is the girls of the house for whom one feels most. Alicia, the
      elder, was seventeen, Elizabeth was but twelve. They must have been
      distracted. So would their father have been if he had had a chance of
      learning all that was going on at Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of course, when young gentlemen of spirit are falling in love with
      beauteous maidens, and retiring to cure themselves by mingling with
      pastoral scenes reminiscent of the gentle melancholy of Mr. Alexander
      Pope's shepherds and shepherdesses (done in Dresden), every one of whom
      murmurs mournfully and melodiously of a rejected suit&mdash;when young
      gentlemen are running away with afflicted damsels and returning to fight
      their enemies, they cannot be expected to think of the incidental expenses
      of the business, which are to be defrayed by their father, any more than
      of the distraction which takes possession of their sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young gentlemen were missing, and had left for their sisters no
      explanation of their absence&mdash;no hint as to the direction of their
      flight. And there were other people in the house talking about the high
      words that had been exchanged between the brothers at midnight. It is not
      surprising that the poor girls should be distressed and distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering that Miss Linley was the first cause of the excitement in the
      midst of which the family had been living for some weeks, it was only
      natural that the elder of the girls should send for her with a view to
      have some light thrown on this new development of the heroic incident in
      which Miss Linley had assisted. But Miss Linley, on being applied to,
      affirmed that she knew nothing of the disappearance of the brothers, that
      she had heard of nothing that should cause them to leave Bath at a
      moment's notice. She was, unfortunately, a young woman of imagination. In
      a crisis such a one is either very helpful, or very helpless. Poor Miss
      Linley was the latter. She had just come through a great crisis in her own
      life, and she had not emerged from it without suffering. It was too much
      to ask her to face another in the family of her friends. She went off in a
      fainting fit on hearing the news of the disappearance of the young men,
      and her father left her in the hands of a medical man, and turned his
      attention to the condition of Miss Sheridan, who was unable to walk back
      to her home, and had to be put into a chair, Mr. Linley walking beside her
      with her young sister. It is more than possible that Mr. Linley was
      beginning to feel that he had had quite enough of the Sheridan family to
      last him for the remainder of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days nothing whatever was heard of the missing brothers. We have
      no means of knowing if Miss Sheridan communicated to their father in
      Dublin the mysterious story she had to tell; the chances are that she was
      advised by Mr. Linley to refrain from doing so until she might have
      something definite to tell him. Mr. Linley never had any particular regard
      for the elder Sheridan, and he had no wish to have him summoned from his
      theatre at Dublin to make his remarks about the dangerous attractiveness
      of Elizabeth Linley, and the culpable carelessness of her father in
      allowing her to be carried off to France by a young man without a penny
      except what he got from his own father.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, Tom Sheridan did not leave his theatre or his pupils in
      elocution, and there was no need for him to do so, for on Tuesday evening&mdash;they
      had been missing on the Sunday morning&mdash;Dick and his brother
      returned. They were both greatly fatigued, and said that they had not been
      in bed since they had left Bath. This meant that Dick had actually not
      slept in Bath since he had originally left the city in the company of Miss
      Linley. Between the Friday and the Tuesday he had posted from London to
      Bath with the Linleys, and had forthwith returned to London with his
      brother and then back once more to Bath without a pause. He, at least, had
      very good reason for feeling fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first act was to hand his sister an apology which had been made to him
      by Mathews. This document is worthy of being reprinted. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being convinced that the expressions I made use of to Mr. Sheridan's
      disadvantage, were the effects of passion and misrepresentation, I intreat
      what I have said to that gentleman's disadvantage, and particularly beg
      his pardon for my advertisement in the <i>Bath Chronicle</i>. Th.
      Mathews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed this document to his sister, and then it may be supposed that he
      went to bed. He had certainly good need of a sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the drift of the story up to this point, as told by Mrs. Lefanu
      (Elizabeth Sheridan), and it differs in some particulars from that told by
      her brother Charles in a letter to their uncle, and, in a lesser degree,
      from the account given of the whole transaction by Richard Sheridan
      himself, who was surely in the best position to know exactly what happened
      upon the occasion of his first visit to Mathews in London, as well as upon
      the occasion of his second, made so hurriedly in the company of his
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      His second visit was, as might have been expected, the more exciting. It
      included the fighting of a duel with Mathews. The humours of duelling have
      been frequently dealt with in prose and comedy, and, assuredly the most
      amusing of all is to be found in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's <i>The Rivals</i>.
      One must confess, however, that the serious account given by the same
      writer of his hostile meeting with Mathews, on his return from Bath,
      suggests a much more ludicrous series of situations than are to be found
      in his play.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sheridan's account he mentions that while still in France he received
      &ldquo;several abusive threats&rdquo; from Mathews, and these had such an effect upon
      him that he wrote to Mathews, swearing that he would not close his eyes in
      sleep in England till he had treated Mathews as he deserved. In order to
      carry out this vow he had actually sat up all night at Canterbury, where
      his party halted on their way from Dover to London. He called upon Mathews
      on arriving in London, at the latter's lodging in Crutched Friars; this
      was at midnight, and the key of the door being mislaid, he had to wait two
      hours before he was admitted. He found Mathews in bed, but he induced him
      to rise and dress, though, in spite of his compliance as regards his
      raiment, he complained bitterly of the cold. There does not seem to have
      been any great suffering on Sheridan's part through a lack of heat. Then,
      as his sister's narrative put it, the man declared that his visitor had
      been grossly misinformed in regard to the libel in the Chronicle; and so
      he left for Bath, as has already been stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now comes the account given by Sheridan of the return visit, and, told
      in his own laconic style, it suggests such comic situations as border on
      farce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. S.,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;staid but three hours in Bath. He returned to London.
      He sent to Mr. M. from Hyde Parck. He came with Captain Knight his second.
      He objected frequently to the ground. They adjourned to the Hercules
      Pillars. They returned to Hyde Parck. Mr. M. objected to the observation
      of an officer. They returned to Hercules Pillars. They adjourned to the
      Bedford Coffee house by agreement. Mr. M. was gone to the Castel Tavern.
      Mr. S. followed with Mr. E. Mr. M. made many declarations in favour of Mr.
      S. They engaged. Mr. M. was disarmed, Captain Knight ran in. Mr. M. begged
      his life and afterwards denied the advantage. Mr. S. was provoked by the
      (really well-meant) interposition of Captain Knight and the illusion of
      Mr. M. He insisted since Mr. M. denied the advantage, that he should give
      up his sword. Mr. M. denied, but sooner than return to his ground he gave
      it up. It was broke, and Mr. M. offered another. He was then called on to
      retract his abuse and beg Mr. S.'s pardon. With much altercation and much
      ill grace he complied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of this remarkably succinct composition is devoted to the
      subsequent misrepresentations of the transaction by Mathews, and by the
      writer's appeal to the seconds to say if his version of the encounter was
      not correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whatever Mathews' account may have been it could scarcely be more
      ludicrous than Sheridan's. The marching and countermarching of the four
      gentlemen&mdash;it appears that brother Charles, although accompanying
      Richard to London, thought it more prudent to remain under cover during
      the actual engagement; he waited at Brereton's lodgings&mdash;the excuses
      made by Mathews in order to get away without fighting, and then at the
      last moment, the carrying out (by agreement) of a manouvre which landed
      Mathews in one tavern and the rest of the party in another&mdash;the
      set-to of the principals immediately after the &ldquo;declarations&rdquo; of one of
      them in favour of the other, and the final catastrophe could hardly be
      surpassed by the actions of a pair of burlesque duellists in what is
      technically known as a &ldquo;knockabout&rdquo; entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after all this scrupulousness of detail one is left in doubt as to the
      exact <i>locale</i> of the encounter. Did it take place in the coffee-room
      of the Castell Inn, or did the eager combatants retrace their steps to the
      &ldquo;parck&rdquo;? The document written by Sheridan, though dealing very fully with
      the forced marches of the army in the field, throws no light upon this
      question of the scene of the battle. In respect of the signing of the
      treaty of peace, and the payment of the indemnity, it is, however,
      moderately lucid. Sheridan must have told his sister that Mathews signed
      the apology immediately after the encounter; she states this in her
      narrative. But Mathews did not merely sign the apology, he wrote every
      word of it, as one may see by referring to the facsimile, thoughtfully
      given in Mr. Fraser Rae's <i>Life of Sheridan</i>, and it would be
      impossible to say that the caligraphy of the apology shows the least sign
      of that perturbation from which one must believe the writer was suffering
      at the moment. Its characteristic is neatness. It is in the fine
      old-fashioned Italian hand. Even an expert, who sees possibilities&mdash;when
      paid for it&mdash;in handwriting which would never occur to less
      imaginative observers, would scarcely venture to say that this neat little
      document was written by a man with another's sword at his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is another element in the mystery of the duel, and it cannot be said
      that when we read the letter which the elder of the brothers wrote to his
      uncle, giving his account of the whole business, we feel ourselves in a
      clearer atmosphere. It really seems a pity that Mr. Browning did not make
      another <i>Ring and the Book</i> series of studies out of this amazing
      duel. Charles Sheridan told his uncle that an apology was given to Richard
      by Mathews as a result of Richard's first visit to him in London, but when
      Richard read the advertisement in the Chronicle, which was the original
      casus belli, he considered this apology so inadequate that he set off for
      London to demand another. Charles also mentions, what neither his brother
      nor his sister had stated, that he himself, on reaching London on the
      Sunday evening, went to Mathews to endeavour to get a suitable apology&mdash;according
      to Richard's narrative Charles had good grounds for sending a challenge to
      Mathews on his own account&mdash;but &ldquo;after two hours' altercation&rdquo; he
      found that he had made no impression upon the man, so that his brother had
      no alternative but to call him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But however the accounts of the lesser details of this affair of honour
      may differ, there can be no question that public opinion in Bath was all
      in favour of young Mr. Sheridan. It was acknowledged on every hand that he
      had acted from the first&mdash;that is, from the moment he assumed the
      duties of the protector of Miss Linley&mdash;with admirable courage, and
      with a full sense of what honour demanded of him. In short he came back
      from London, after so many sleepless nights, covered with glory. He was a
      tall, handsome fellow of twenty, with brilliant eyes; he had run away with
      the most beautiful girl in the world to save her from the clutches of a
      scoundrel; he had had four nights without sleep, and then he had fought a
      duel with the scoundrel and had obtained from him an apology for insertion
      in the newspapers. Few young gentlemen starting life wholly without means
      attain to so proud a position of achievement before they reach their
      majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of course all these feats of errantry and arms run up a bill. Young
      Mr. Sheridan's posting account must have been by itself pretty formidable,
      and, knowing that his father had never looked on him with the favour which
      he gave to his brother, Richard may now and again have felt a trifle
      uneasy at the prospect of meeting Mr. Sheridan. If his sister's memory is
      to be trusted, however, this meeting took place within a week or two of
      his duel, and no bones were broken. Mr. Sheridan had a few chiding words
      to say respecting the debts which his son had incurred, but these he paid,
      after obtaining from the boy the usual promise made under similar
      conditions before a like tribunal. The prodigal invariably acts up to his
      character for prodigality in the matter of promises of reform.
    </p>

      Richard Sheridan, being something of a wit, though we do not get many
      examples of his faculty in the accounts extant of his early life, and
      assuredly not a single example in any of his letters that came into the
      hands of his biographers, may have sworn to his father never to run away
      with a girl who might be anxious to enter upon a conventual life. At any
      rate, his father did not show any great displeasure when he was made aware
      of the boy's conduct, though it is worth noting that Mr. Sheridan took
      exception to the general conviction that his son's act had been prompted
      by the most chivalrous aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathews, however, had not yet been shaken off. He was back in Bath almost
      as soon as the Sheridans, and &ldquo;malevolent incendiarism&rdquo; was in the air. No
      slander was too base for him to use against Richard Sheridan, no
      insinuation too vile. But the popularity of the object of his calumny was
      now too firmly established in Bath to be shaken by the vaporous
      malevolence of his enemy. Mathews, finding himself thoroughly discredited
      in every quarter, did the only sensible thing recorded in his squalid
      history&mdash;he ran away to his home in Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was here unfortunate enough to meet with a man named Barnard, or
      Barnett, who acted upon him pretty much as Sir Lucius O'Trigger did upon
      Squire Acres, explaining to him that it was quite impossible that the
      affair between him and Sheridan should remain as it was. It was absolutely
      necessary, he said, that another duel should take place. All the
      &ldquo;incendiarism&rdquo; in Mathews' nature was aroused by the fiery words of this
      man, and the precious pair hurried to Bath, where a challenge was sent to
      Sheridan through the hands of his eldest sister, under the guise of an
      invitation to some festivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheridan was foolish enough to accept the challenge apparently without
      consulting with any one competent to advise him. According to his father
      the challenge had been preceded by several letters of the most scurrilous
      abuse. His wiser brother, who had just received an appointment as
      Secretary to the British Legation in Sweden, had gone to London with their
      father to make preparations for his departure for Stockholm, and
      immediately on hearing of the duel he wrote to Richard a typical elder
      brother's letter. It is dated July 3rd, 1772, so that, as the duel had
      only taken place the previous day, it cannot be said that he lost much
      time in expressing his deep sense of his brother's foolishness in meeting
      so great a scoundrel for the second time. &ldquo;All your friends have condemned
      you,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;You risked everything, where you had nothing to gain, to
      give your antagonist the thing he wished, a chance for recovering his
      reputation; he wanted to get rid of the contemptible opinion he was held
      in, and you were good-natured enough to let him do it at your expense. It
      is not a time to scold, but all your friends were of opinion you could,
      with the greatest propriety, have refused to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without going into the question as to whether this sort of letter was the
      ideal one for one brother to write to another who was lying on his bed
      with several wounds in his throat, it is impossible to question the
      soundness of the opinion expressed by Charles Sheridan in respect of
      Richard's acceptance of Mathews' challenge. The challenge was, however,
      accepted, and the duel took place on King's Down, at three o'clock in the
      morning. Mathews' friend was Barnett, and Sheridan's a young gentleman
      named Paumier, who, it was said, was quite unacquainted with the rules of
      the game, and had never even seen a duel being fought. The accounts which
      survive of this second meeting of Sheridan and Mathews make it apparent
      that, if the first was a scene of comedy, this one was a tragic burlesque.
      It is said that Sheridan, on the signal being given, at once rushed in on
      his antagonist, endeavouring to disarm him as he had done upon the former
      occasion of their meeting, but, tripping over something, he literally, and
      not figuratively, fell upon the other, knocking him down with such
      violence that he was not only disarmed, but his sword was broken as well.
      Sheridan's own sword was also broken, so that one might fancy that the
      meeting would have terminated here. It did nothing of the sort. The
      encounter was only beginning, and anything more savagely burlesque than
      the sequel could not be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combatants must have rolled over, after the manner of the negro
      duellists on the variety stage, and when they had settled themselves each
      made a grab for the most serviceable fragment of his sword. Mathews being
      the heavier man contrived to keep uppermost in the scuffle, and, what gave
      him a decided advantage over his opponent, he managed to get his fingers
      on the hilt of his broken weapon. An appeal at this stage was made by the
      lad who was acting as Sheridan's second to put a stop to the fight; but
      the second ruffian, or the ruffian's second&mdash;either description
      applies to Barnett&mdash;declared that as both the antagonists were on the
      ground one could not be said to have any advantage over the other. This
      delicate question being settled, Mathews held the jagged, saw-like end&mdash;point
      it had none&mdash;of the broken sword at the other's throat and told him
      to beg for his life. Sheridan replied that he should refuse to beg his
      life from such a scoundrel, and forthwith the scoundrel began jabbing at
      his throat and face with the fragment of his weapon, a method of attack
      which was not robbed of its butchery by the appeal that it makes to a
      reader's sense of its comical aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful, however, if the comic side of the transaction appealed
      very forcibly to the unfortunate boy who was being lacerated to death. He
      just managed to put aside a thrust or two before the end of the blade
      penetrated the flesh of his throat and pinned him to the ground. With a
      chuckle and, according to Tom Sheridan's account, an oath, Mathews got
      upon his feet, and, entering the coach which was waiting for him, drove
      away from the scene of his butchery. Sheridan was thereupon raised from
      the ground, and driven in his chaise with his second to the White Hart
      Inn. Two surgeons were immediately in attendance, and it was found that
      his wounds, though numerous, were not such as placed his life in jeopardy.
      They were, however, sufficiently serious to prevent his removal to his
      home that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not appear that young Paumier told the sisters of the occurrence;
      but an account of the duel having appeared in the <i>Bath Chronicle</i>
      the same afternoon, every one in the town must have been talking of it,
      though Mrs. Lefanu says neither she nor her sister heard a word of the
      matter until the next day. Then they hastened to the White Hart, and
      prevailed upon the surgeons to allow them to take their brother home. In a
      surprisingly short time he had quite recovered. Indeed, although there was
      a report that Sheridan's life was despaired of, there was no excuse for
      any one taking so gloomy a view of his hurts, for the exact truth was
      known to Charles Sheridan and his father in London early on the day
      following that of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pathetic part of the story of this ludicrous encounter is to be found
      in the story of the reception of the news by Elizabeth Linley. Her father
      had read in some of the papers that Sheridan was at the point of death,
      but, like the worldly-wise man that Mr. Linley was, he kept the news from
      his daughter. They were at Oxford together, and she was announced to sing
      at a concert, and he knew that had she learned all that the newspapers
      published, she might possibly not be able to do herself&mdash;and her
      father&mdash;justice. But, as one of the audience told his sister
      afterwards, the fact that every one who had come to hear Miss Linley sing
      was aware of the serious condition (as the papers alleged) of young
      Sheridan, and of her attachment to him, a feeling of sympathy for the
      lovely young creature added immeasurably to the interest of her
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of the concert her father set out with her for Bath; and
      it was not until they had almost reached their home that their chaise was
      met by a clergyman named Pauton, and he summoned all his tact to enable
      him to prepare Elizabeth Linley for the news which he was entrusted to
      communicate to her. It is said that under the stress of her emotion the
      girl declared that Richard Sheridan was her husband, and that her place
      was by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever truth there may be in this story it is certain that if she
      believed at that moment that Sheridan was her husband, she gave no sign of
      continuing in that belief, for though her numerous letters to him show
      that she was devoted to him, there is no suggestion in any of them that
      she believed herself to be his wife. On the contrary, there are many
      passages which prove that no idea of the sort was entertained by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exertions of the heads of the two families were for long directed
      against the union of the lovers. Mr. Linley felt more forcibly than ever
      that he had had quite enough of the Sheridans, and Tom Sheridan doubtless
      wished never to hear again the name of Linley. The one made his daughter
      promise on her knees to give up Richard Sheridan, and Mr. Sheridan
      compelled his son to forswear any association with Elizabeth Linley. Jove
      must have been convulsed with laughter. Richard Brinsley Sheridan and
      Elizabeth Ann Linley were married on the 13th of April, 1773.

    <h2>
      A MELODRAMA AT COVENT GARDEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N an evening in
      April, 1779, the play, &ldquo;<i>Love in a Village</i>&rdquo; was being performed at
      Covent Garden Theatre before a large audience. In the front row of the
      boxes sat two ladies, one of them young and handsome, the other not so
      young and not so beautiful&mdash;a dark-faced, dark-eyed woman whom no one
      could mistake for any nationality except Italian. Three gentlemen who sat
      behind them were plainly of their party&mdash;elegant gentlemen of
      fashion, one of them an Irish peer. Every person of quality in the theatre
      and a good many others without such a claim to distinction, were aware of
      the fact that the most attractive member of the group was Miss Reay, a
      lady whose name had been for several years closely associated&mdash;very
      closely indeed&mdash;with that of Lord Sandwich, the First Lord of the
      Admiralty, and one of the most unpopular men in England. She had driven to
      the theatre in his lordship's carriage, and two of the gentlemen with whom
      she conversed freely in the box were high officials of the department over
      which his lordship presided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost from the moment of her arrival, Miss Reay and her friends were
      watched eagerly by a hollow-eyed, morose gentleman in black. He looked as
      if he had not slept for many nights; and no one observing him could have
      failed to perceive that he had come to the theatre not for the sake of the
      play which was being performed, but to watch the lady. He kept his fierce
      eyes fixed upon her, and he frowned every time that she turned to make a
      remark to one of her friends; his eyes blazed every time that one of her
      friends smiled over her shoulder, and his hands clenched if she smiled in
      return. Several times it seemed as if he found it impossible to remain in
      his place in the upper side box, where his seat was, for he started up and
      hurried out to the great lobby, walking to and fro in great agitation.
      More than once he strode away from the lobby into the Bedford Coffee House
      just outside the theatre, and there partook of brandy and water, returning
      after brief intervals to stare at Miss Reay and her companions in the
      front row of the boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0015" id="linkimage-0015"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0327.jpg" alt="0327 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0327.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of the play, he went hastily into the vestibule,
      standing to one side, not far from the exit from the boxes; but if he
      intended to be close to Miss Reay while she walked to the main exit, his
      object was defeated by reason of the crush of people congregating in the
      vestibule, the people of quality waiting for their carriages to be
      announced, the others waiting for the satisfaction of being in such close
      proximity to people of quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the crowd there was a lady who had recently become the wife of a
      curious gentleman named Lewis, who some years later wrote a grisly book
      entitled <i>The Monk</i>, bringing him such great fame as cancelled for
      posterity the names of Matthew Gregory, given to him by his parents, and
      caused him to be identified by the name of his book only. This lady made a
      remark to her neighbour in respect of a lovely rose which Miss Reay was
      wearing when she left the box exit and stood in the vestibule&mdash;a
      beautiful rose early in the month of April might have excited remark in
      those days; at any rate, Mrs. Lewis has left the record that at the very
      moment of her speaking, the rose fell to the floor, and Miss Reay appeared
      to be profoundly affected by this trifling incident, and said in a
      faltering voice, &ldquo;I trust that I am not to consider this as an evil omen!&rdquo;
       So Mrs. Lewis stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Lord Sandwich's carriage was announced, and Miss Reay
      and her companion made a move in the direction of the door. The gentlemen
      of the party seem to have left earlier, for on the ladies being impeded by
      the crush in the vestibule, a stranger, named Mr. Macnamara, of Lincoln's
      Inn, proffered his services to help them to get to the carriage. Miss Reay
      thanked him, took his arm, and the crowd opened for them in some measure.
      It quickly opened wider under a more acute persuasion a few seconds later,
      when the morose gentleman in black pushed his way among the people until
      he was within a few feet of the lady and her escort. Only for a second did
      he pause&mdash;certainly he spoke no word to Miss Reay or any one else&mdash;before
      he pulled a pistol from his pocket and fired almost point-blank at her
      before any one could knock up his hand. Immediately afterwards he turned a
      second pistol against his own forehead and pulled the trigger, and fell to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene that followed can easily be imagined. Every woman present
      shrieked, except Miss Reay, who was supported by Mr. Macnamara. The
      ghastly effects of the bullet were apparent not only upon the forehead of
      the lady where it lodged, but upon the bespattered garments of every one
      about the door, and upon the columns of the hall. Above the shrieks of the
      terror-stricken people were heard the yells of the murderer, who lay on
      the ground, hammering at his head with the butt end of his weapon, and
      crying, &ldquo;Kill me! Kill me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A Mr. Mahon, of Russell Street, who was said to be an apothecary, was the
      first to lay a hand upon the wretched man. He wrested the pistol from his
      grasp and prevented him from doing further mischief to himself. He was
      quickly handed over to the police, and, with his unfortunate victim, was
      removed to the Shakespeare Tavern, a surgeon named Bond being in prompt
      attendance. It did not take long to find that Miss Reay had never breathed
      after the shot had been fired at her; the bullet had smashed the skull and
      passed through the brain. The man remained for some time unconscious, but
      even before he recovered he was identified as James Hackman, a gentleman
      who had been an officer in the army, and on retiring had taken Orders,
      being admitted a priest of the Church of England scarcely a month before
      his crime. There were rumours respecting his infatuation for Miss Reay,
      and in a surprisingly short space of time, owing most likely to the
      exertions of Signora Galli, the Italian whom Lord Sandwich had hired to be
      her companion, the greater part of the romantic story of the wretched
      man's life, as far as it related to Miss Reay, was revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It formed a nine days' wonder during the spring of the same year (1779).
      The grief displayed by Lord Sandwich on being made acquainted with the
      circumstances of the murder was freely commented on, and the sympathy
      which was felt for him may have diminished in some measure from his
      unpopularity. The story told by Croker of the reception of the news by
      Lord Sandwich is certainly not deficient in detail. &ldquo;He stood as it were
      petrified,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;till suddenly, seizing a candle, he ran upstairs
      and threw himself on the bed, and in agony exclaimed, 'Leave me for a
      while to myself, I could have borne anything but this!' The attendants
      remained for a considerable time at the top of the staircase, till his
      lordship rang the bell and ordered that they should all go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before his lordship left the scene of his grief in the morning Sir John
      Fielding, the Bow Street magistrate, had arrived at the Shakespeare Tavern
      from his house at Brompton, and, after a brief inquiry, ordered Hackman to
      be taken to Tothill Fields Prison. In due course he was committed to
      Newgate, and on April 16th his trial took place before Blackstone, the
      Recorder. The facts of the tragedy were deposed to by several witnesses,
      and the cause of the lady's death was certified by Mr. Bond, the surgeon.
      The prisoner was then called on for his defence. He made a brief speech,
      explaining that he would have pleaded guilty at once had he not felt that
      doing so &ldquo;would give an indication of contemning death, not suitable to my
      present condition, and would in some measure make me accessory to a second
      peril of my life. And I likewise thought,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that the justice of
      my country ought to be satisfied by suffering my offence to be proved, and
      the fact to be established by evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This curious affectation of a finer perception of the balance of justice
      than is possessed by most men was quite characteristic of this man, as was
      also his subsequent expression of his willingness to submit to the
      sentence of the court. His counsel endeavoured to show that he had been
      insane from the moment of his purchasing his pistols until he had
      committed the deed for which he was being tried&mdash;he did not say
      anything about &ldquo;a wave of insanity,&rdquo; however, though that picturesque
      phrase would have aptly described the nature of his plea. He argued that a
      letter which was found in the prisoner's pocket, and in which suicide only
      was threatened, should be accepted as proof that he had no intention of
      killing Miss Reay when he went to the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Recorder, of course, made short work of such a plea. He explained to
      the jury that &ldquo;for a plea of insanity to be successful it must be shown
      not merely that it was a matter of fits and starts, but that it was a
      definite thing&mdash;a total loss of reason and incapability of reason.&rdquo;
       Referring to the letter, he said that it seemed to him to argue a coolness
      and premeditation incompatible with such insanity as he described.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was, as might have been anticipated, the jury, without leaving
      the box, found Hackman guilty, and he was sentenced to be hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boswell, who was nearly as fond of hearing death-sentences pronounced
      as he was of seeing them carried out, was present in the court during the
      trial, and to him Mr. Booth, the brother-in-law of the prisoner, applied&mdash;he
      himself had been too greatly agitated to be able to remain in the court&mdash;for
      information as to how Hackman had deported himself, and Boswell was able
      to assure him that he had behaved &ldquo;as well, sir, as you or any of his
      friends could wish; with decency, propriety, and in such a manner as to
      interest every one present. He might have pleaded that he shot Miss Reay
      by accident, but he fairly told the truth that in a moment of frenzy he
      did intend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was in the condemned cell at Newgate he received a message from
      Lord Sandwich to the effect that if he wished for his life, he (Lord
      Sandwich) had influence with the King, and might succeed in obtaining a
      commutation of his sentence. Hackman replied that he had no wish to live,
      but he implored his lordship to give him such assurance that those whom
      Miss Reay had left behind her would be carefully looked after, as would,
      on meeting her in another world, enable him to make this pleasing
      communication to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the few days that remained to him in writing fervid letters to
      his friends and in penning moralisings, in a style which was just the
      smallest degree more pronounced than that which was fashionable at his
      period&mdash;the style of the sentimental hero of Richardson and his
      inferior followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His execution at Tyburn attracted the most enormous crowds ever seen upon
      such an occasion. The carriage in which the wretched man was conveyed to
      the gibbet could only proceed at a walking pace; but still, the vehicle
      which followed it, containing the Earl of Carlisle and James Boswell,
      arrived in good time for the final scene of this singular tragedy, which
      for weeks, as the Countess of Ossory wrote to George Selwyn, was the sole
      topic of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as a matter of course, Horace Walpole had something to communicate to
      one of his carefully-selected correspondents. Oddly enough it was to a
      parson he wrote to express the opinion that he was still uncertain
      &ldquo;whether our clergy are growing Mahometans or not&rdquo;; adding sagely, &ldquo;they
      certainly are not what they profess themselves; but as you and I should
      not agree, perhaps, in assigning the same defects to them, I will not
      enter on a subject which I have promised you to drop, all I allude to now
      is the shocking murder of Miss Reay by a divine. In my own opinion we are
      growing more fit for Bedlam than for Mahomet's paradise. The poor
      criminal, I am persuaded, is mad, and the misfortune is the law does not
      know how to define the shades of madness; and thus there are twenty
      out-pensioners of Bedlam for one that is confined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most persons will come to the conclusion that the judge who tried Hackman
      made a most successful attempt to expound to the jury exactly where the
      law drew a line in differentiating between the man who should be sent to
      Bedlam and the man who should be sent to Tyburn, and will agree with the
      justice of the law that condemned to the gallows this divine of three
      weeks' standing for committing an atrocious crime, even though the chances
      are that Hackman spoke the truth when he affirmed that he had brought his
      pistols down to the theatre with no more felonious intent than to blow out
      his own brains in the presence of the lady and to fall dead at her feet.
      At the same time one is not precluded from agreeing with Walpole's opinion
      that the people of his period were growing more fit for Bedlam than for
      Eblis.

      The truth is that an extraordinary wave of what was called &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo;
       was passing over England at that time. It was a wave of sentimentality&mdash;that
      maudlin sentimentality which was the exquisite characteristic of the hero
      and heroine of almost every novel that attained to any degree of success.
      To people who have formed their ideas of the latter half of the eighteenth
      century from studying Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>, every page of
      which shows a healthy common sense; or from the plates of Hogarth&mdash;robust
      even to a point of vulgarity&mdash;it would seem incredible that there
      should exist in England at practically the same time a cult of the maudlin
      and the lachrymose. Such a cult had, however, obtained so great a hold on
      a large section of society that all the satire of Smollett, Sterne, and
      Goldsmith, was unable to ridicule it out of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the worst of the matter was that the types of these weeping
      sentimentalists were not unreal. They began by being unreal, but in the
      course of a short time they became real, the fact being that people in all
      directions began to frame their conduct and their conversation upon these
      flaccid creatures of the unhealthy fancy of third-rate novelists and
      fourth-rate poetasters. More than once, it may be remarked, even in our
      own time &ldquo;movements&rdquo; have had their origin in the fancy of a painter&mdash;in
      one case of a subtle caricaturist. An artist possessed of a distorted
      sense of what is beautiful in woman has been able to set a certain fashion
      in the unreal, until people were well-nigh persuaded that it was the
      painter who had taken the figures in his pictures from the persons who had
      simply sought a cheap notoriety by adopting the pose and the dress of the
      scraggy posturantes for whose anatomy he was responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that, when certain novel-writers in the eighteenth century,
      having no experience of the life which they attempted to depict, brought
      forth creatures out of their own unhealthy imaginations, and placed them
      before their readers as types of heroes and heroines, the public never
      failed to include quite a number of readers who were ready to live up to
      all those essentials that constituted the personages of the fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not alone over England had the sighs of a perpetually sighing hero and
      heroine sent a lachrymose flood; France and Germany, if not actually
      inundated, were at least rendered humid by its influence. <i>The Sorrows
      of Werther</i> was only one of the many books which helped on the cult of
      the sentimental, and it was as widely read in England as in Germany.
      Gessner's <i>Death of Abel</i> had an enormous vogue in its English
      translation. The boarding-school version of the tale of Abelard and
      Heloise was also much wept over both in France and Germany; and the true
      story of James Hackman and Martha Reay, as recorded by the correspondence
      of the pair, published shortly after the last scene in the tragedy had
      been enacted, and reissued with connecting notes some twelve years ago,
      might pass only as a somewhat crude attempt to surpass these masterpieces
      of fancy-woven woes. James and Martha might have been as happy as
      thousands of other Jameses and Marthas have been, but they chose to
      believe that the Fates were bothering themselves with this particular case
      of James and Martha&mdash;they chose to feel that they were doomed to a
      life of sorrowful love&mdash;at any rate, this was Martha's notion&mdash;and
      they kept on exchanging emotional sentiments until James's poor head gave
      way, and he sought to end up their romance in accordance with the mode of
      the best models, stretching himself a pallid corpse at the feet of his
      Martha; but then it was that Fate put out a meddlesome finger, and so
      caused the scene of the last chapter to take place at Tyburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The romance of Mr. Hackman and Miss Reay would never have taken place, if
      Lord Sandwich had been as exemplary a husband as George III or Dr. Johnson
      or Edmund Burke&mdash;the only exemplary husbands of the eighteenth
      century that one can recall at a moment's notice. Unhappily his lordship
      was one of the many examples of the unexemplary husband of that period. If
      the Earl of Chesterfield advanced the ill-treatment of a wife to one of
      the fine arts, it may be said that the Earl of Sandwich made it one of the
      coarse. He was brutal in his treatment of the Countess, and never more so
      than when he purchased the pretty child that Miss Reay must have been at
      the age of thirteen, and had her educated to suit his tastes. He went
      about the transaction with the same deliberation as a gourmand might
      display in ordering his dinner. He was extremely fond of music, so he had
      the child's education in this direction carefully attended to. His place
      at Hinchinbrook had been the scene of the performance of several
      oratorios, his lordship taking his place in the orchestra at the
      kettledrums; and he hoped that by the time he should have his purchase
      sent home, her voice would be equal to the demands put upon it by the most
      exacting of the sacred soprano music of Handel or Gluck.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it turned out he was not disappointed. Martha Reay, when she went to
      live at Hinchinbrook at the age of eighteen, showed herself to be a most
      accomplished young lady, as she certainly was a very charming one. She was
      found to possess a lovely voice, and was quite fitted to take her place,
      not merely in his lordship's music-room, but also in his drawing-room to
      which he advanced her. To say that she was treated as one of his
      lordship's family would be to convey a wrong impression, considering how
      he treated the principal member of his family, but certainly he introduced
      her to his guests, and she took her place at his table at dinner parties.
      He even put her next to the wife of a bishop upon one occasion, feeling
      sure that she would captivate that lady, and as it turned out, his
      anticipations were fully realised; only the bishop's lady, on making
      inquiries later on, protested that she was scandalised by being placed in
      such a position as permitted of her yielding to the fascinations of a
      young person occupying a somewhat equivocal position in the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when she was at Hinchinbrook, in October, 1775, that Miss Reay met
      the man who was to play so important a part in her life&mdash;and death.
      Cradock, the &ldquo;country gentleman,&rdquo; tells in his <i>Memoirs</i> the story of
      the first meeting of the two. Lord Sandwich was anxious that a friend of
      his own should be elected to a professorship at Cambridge, and Cradock,
      having a vote, was invited to use it on behalf of his lordship's
      candidate, and to stay for a night at Hinchinbrook on his way back to
      London. He travelled in Lord Sandwich's coach, and when in the act of
      driving through the gateway at Hinchinbrook, it overtook a certain Major
      Reynolds and another officer who was stationed on recruiting duty in the
      neighbourhood. Lord Sandwich, being acquainted with Reynolds, dismounted
      and invited him and his friend to a family dinner at his lordship's place
      that evening. Major Reynolds expressed his appreciation of this act of
      courtesy, and introduced his friend as Captain Hackman. The party was a
      simple affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It consisted of Lord Sandwich, Miss Reay, another lady, the two officers,
      and Mr. Cradock. After coffee had been served two rubbers of whist were
      played, and the party broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first meeting of Hackman and Miss Reay. They seem to have
      fallen in love immediately, each with the other, for the first letter in
      the correspondence, written in December, 1775, contains a good deal that
      suggests the adolescence of a passion. Hackman was a man of education and
      some culture, and he showed few signs of developing into that maudlin
      sentimentalist who corresponded with the lady a year or two later. He was
      but twenty-three years of age, the son of a retired officer in the navy,
      who had sent him to St. John's College, Cambridge, and afterwards bought
      him a commission in the 68th Foot. He was probably only an ensign when he
      was stationed at Huntingdon, but being in charge of the recruiting party,
      enjoyed the temporary rank of captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have had a pretty fair conceit of his own ability as a
      correspondent, for he kept a copy of his love letters. Of course, there is
      no means of ascertaining if he kept copies of all that he ever wrote; he
      may have sent off some in the hot passion of the moment, but those which
      passed into the hands of his brother-in-law and were afterwards published,
      were copies which he had retained. Miss Reay was doubtless discreet enough
      to destroy the originals before they had a chance of falling into the
      hands of Lord Sandwich. It is difficult for us who live in this age of
      scrawls and &ldquo;correspondence cards&rdquo; to imagine the existence of that
      enormous army of letter-writers who flourished their quills in the
      eighteenth century, for the entertainment of their descendants in the
      nineteenth and twentieth; but still more difficult is it to understand
      how, before the invention of any mechanical means of reproducing
      manuscript, these voluminous correspondents first made a rough draft of
      every letter, then corrected and afterwards copied it, before sending it&mdash;securing
      a frank from a friendly Member of Parliament&mdash;to its destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superlatively difficult is it to imagine an ardent lover sitting down to
      transcribe into the pages of a notebook the outpourings of his passion.
      But this is what Ensign Hackman did, although so far as the consequences
      of his love-making were concerned, he is deserving of a far higher place
      among great lovers than Charlotte's Werther, or Mr. Swinburne's Dolores.
      Charlotte we know &ldquo;went on cutting bread and butter&rdquo; after the death of
      her honourable lover; but poor little Miss Reay was the victim of the
      passion which she undoubtedly fanned into a flame of madness. Ensign
      Hackman made copies of his love-letters, and we are grateful to him, for
      by their aid we can perceive the progress of his disease. They are like
      the successive pictures in a biograph series lately exhibited at a
      conversazione of the Royal Society, showing the development of a blossom
      into a perfect flower. We see by the aid of these letters how he gave way
      under the attack of what we should now call the bacillus of that maudlin
      sentimentality which was in the air in his day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began his love-letters like a gallant officer, but ended them in the
      strain of the distracted curate who had been jilted just when he has laid
      down the cork lino in the new study and got rid of the plumbers. He wrote
      merrily of his &ldquo;Corporal Trim,&rdquo; who was the bearer of a &ldquo;billet&rdquo; from her.
      &ldquo;He will be as good a soldier to Cupid as to Mars, I dare say. And Mars
      and Cupid are not now to begin their acquaintance, you know.&rdquo; Then he goes
      on to talk in a fine soldierly strain of the drum &ldquo;beating for volunteers
      to Bacchus. In plain English, the drum tells me dinner is ready, for a
      drum gives us bloody-minded heroes an appetite for eating as well as for
      fighting.... Adieu&mdash;whatever hard service I may have after dinner, no
      quantity of wine shall make me let drop or forget my appointment with you
      tomorrow. We certainly were not seen yesterday, for reasons I will give
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter was written on December 7th, and it was followed by another
      the next day, and a still longer one the day following. In fact, Corporal
      Trim must have been kept as busy as his original in the service of Uncle
      Toby, during the month of December, his duty being to receive the lady's
      letters, as well as to deliver the gentleman's, and he seems to have been
      equally a pattern of fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hackman's letters at this time were models of good taste, with only the
      smallest amount of swagger in them. His intentions were strictly
      honourable, and they were not concealed within any cocoon of sentimental
      phraseology. One gathers from his first letters that he was a simple and
      straightforward gentleman, who, having fallen pretty deeply in love with a
      young woman, seeks to make her his wife at the earliest possible moment.
      Unfortunately however, the lady had fallen under the influence of the
      prevailing affectation, and her scheme of life did not include a
      commonplace marriage with a subaltern in a marching regiment. One might be
      disposed to say that she knew when she was well off. The aspiration to be
      made &ldquo;a respectable woman&rdquo; by marriage in a church was not sufficiently
      strong in her to compel her to sacrifice the many good things with which
      she was surrounded, in order to realise it. But, of course, she was ready
      to pose as a miserable woman, linked to a man whom she did not love, but
      too honourable to leave him, and far too thoughtful for the career of the
      man whom she did love with all her soul ever to become a burden to him.
      She had read the ballad of &ldquo;Auld Robin Gray&rdquo;&mdash;she quoted it in full
      in one of her letters&mdash;and she was greatly interested to find how
      closely her case resembled that of the wife in the poem. She had brought
      herself to think of the man who had bought her just as he would buy a
      peach tree, or a new tulip, as her &ldquo;benefactor.&rdquo; Did she not owe to him
      the blessing of a good education, and the culture of her voice, her
      knowledge of painting&mdash;nay, her &ldquo;keep&rdquo; for several years, and her
      introduction to the people of quality who visited at Hinchinbrook and at
      the Admiralty? She seemed to think it impossible for any one to doubt that
      Lord Sandwich had acted toward her with extraordinary generosity, and that
      she would be showing the most contemptible ingratitude were she to forsake
      so noble a benefactor. But all the same she found Hinchinbrook intolerably
      dull at times, and she was so pleased at the prospect of having a lover,
      that she came to fancy that she loved the first one who turned up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was undoubtedly greatly impressed by the ballad of &ldquo;Auld Robin Gray,&rdquo;
       and she at once accepted the rôle of the unhappy wife, only she found it
      convenient to modify one rather important line&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fain would think o' Jamie, but that would be a sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was fain to think on her Jamie whether it was a sin or not, but she
      did so without having the smallest intention of leaving her Auld Robin
      Gray. So whimsical an interpretation of the poem could scarcely occur to
      any one not under the influence of the sentimental malady of the day; but
      it served both for Miss Reay and her Jamie. They accepted it, and became
      deeply sensible of its pathos as applied to themselves. Ensign Hackman
      assured her that he was too high-minded to dream of making love to her
      under the roof of Lord Sandwich, her &ldquo;benefactor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our love, the inexorable tyrant of our hearts,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;claims his
      sacrifices, but does not bid us insult his lordship's walls with it. How
      civilly did he invite me to Hinchinbrook in October last, though an
      unknown recruiting officer. How politely himself first introduced me to
      himself! Often has the recollection made me struggle with my passion.
      Still it shall restrain it on this side honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was in reply to her remonstrance, and probably she regretted that she
      had been so strenuous in pointing out to him how dreadful it would be were
      she to show herself wanting in gratitude to Lord Sandwich. She wanted to
      play the part of Jenny, the lawful wife of Robin Gray, with as few
      sacrifices as possible, and she had no idea of sacrificing young Jamie,
      the lover, any more than she had of relinquishing the many privileges she
      enjoyed at Hinchinbrook by making Jamie the lover into Jamie the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very curious to find Hackman protesting to her all this time that
      his passions are &ldquo;wild as the torrent's roar,&rdquo; apologising for making his
      simile water when the element most congenial to his nature was fire.
      &ldquo;Swift had water in his brain. I have a burning coal of fire; your hand
      can light it up to rapture, rage, or madness. Men, real men, have never
      been wild enough for my admiration, it has wandered into the ideal world
      of fancy. Othello (but he should have put himself to death in his wife's
      sight, not his wife), Zanga are my heroes. Milk-and-water passions are
      like sentimental comedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Read in the light of future events this letter has a peculiar
      significance. Although he became more sentimental than the hero of any of
      the comedies at which he was sneering, he was still able to make an honest
      attempt to act up to his ideal of Othello. &ldquo;<i>He should have put himself
      to death in his wife's sight</i>.&rdquo; It will be remembered that he pleaded
      at his trial that he had no design upon the life of Miss Reay, but only
      aimed at throwing himself dead at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally significant are some of the passages in the next letters which he
      wrote to her. They show that even within the first month of his
      acquaintance with his Martha his mind had a peculiar bent. He was giving
      his attention to Hervey's <i>Meditations</i>, and takes pains to point out
      to her two passages which he affirms to be as fine as they are natural.
      Did ever love-letter contain anything so grisly? &ldquo;A beam or two finds its
      way through the grates (of the vault), and reflects a feeble glimness from
      the nails of the coffins.&rdquo; This is one passage&mdash;ghastly enough in all
      conscience. But it is surpassed by the others which he quotes: &ldquo;Should the
      haggard skeleton lift a clattering hand.&rdquo; Respecting the latter he
      remarks, &ldquo;I know not whether the epithet 'haggard' might not be spared.&rdquo;
       It is possible that the lady on receiving this curious love-letter was
      under the impression that the whole passage might have been spared her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he seems to have been supping off horrors at this time, for he goes on
      to tell a revolting story about the black hole of Calcutta; and then he
      returns with zest to his former theme of murder and suicide. He had been
      reading the poem of &ldquo;Faldoni and Teresa,&rdquo; by Jerningham, and he criticises
      it quite admirably. &ldquo;The melancholy tale will not take up three words,
      though Mr. J. has bestowed upon it 335 melancholy lines,&rdquo; he tells the
      young lady. &ldquo;Two lovers, meeting with an invincible object to their union,
      determined to put an end to their existence with pistols. The place they
      chose for the execution of their terrible project was a chapel that stood
      at a little distance from the house. They even decorated the altar for the
      occasion, they paid a particular attention to their own dress. Teresa was
      dressed in white with rose-coloured ribbands. The same coloured ribbands
      were tied to the pistols. Each held the ribband that was fastened to the
      other's trigger, which they drew at a certain signal.&rdquo; His criticism of
      the poem includes the remark that Faldoni and Teresa might be prevented
      from making proselytes by working up their affecting story so as to take
      off the edge of the dangerous example they offer. This, he says, the
      author has failed to do, and he certainly proves his point later by
      affirming that &ldquo;while I talk of taking off the dangerous edge of their
      example, they have almost listed me under their bloody banners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This shows the morbid tendency of the man's mind, though it must be
      confessed that nearly all the remarks which he makes on ordinary topics
      are eminently sane and well considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later we find him entering with enthusiasm into a scheme,
      suggested by her, of meeting while she was on her way to London, and it is
      plain from the rapturous letter which he wrote to her that their plot was
      successful; but when she reached town she had a great deal to occupy her,
      so that it is not strange she should neglect him for a time. The fact was,
      as Cradock states in his <i>Memoirs</i>, that the unpopularity of Lord
      Sandwich and Miss Reay had increased during the winter to such a point
      that it became dangerous for them to show themselves together in public.
      Ribald ballads were sung under the windows of the Admiralty, and Cradock
      more than once heard some strange insults shouted out by people in the
      park. It was at this time that she spoke to Cradock about appearing in
      opera, and he states that it reached his ears that she had been offered
      three thousand pounds and a free benefit (a possible extra five hundred)
      for one season's performances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if she had really been in love with Hackman this was surely the moment
      when she should have gone to him, suffered him to marry her, and thus made
      up by a few years on the lyric stage for any deficiency in his fortune or
      for the forfeiture of any settlement her &ldquo;benefactor&rdquo; might have been
      disposed to make in her favour. But she seems to have shown a remarkable
      amount of prudence throughout the whole of her intrigue, and she certainly
      had a premonition of the danger to which she was exposed by her connection
      with him. &ldquo;Fate stands between us,&rdquo; she wrote in reply to one of his
      impetuous upbraiding letters. &ldquo;We are doomed to be wretched. And I, every
      now and then, think some terrible catastrophe will be the result of our
      connection. 'Some dire event,' as Storge prophetically says in <i>Jephtha</i>,
      'hangs over our heads.' Oh, that it were no crime to quit this world like
      Faldoni and Teresa... by your hand I could even die with pleasure. I know
      I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An extraordinary premonition, beyond doubt, to write thus, and one is
      tempted to believe that she had ceased for a moment merely to play the
      part of the afflicted heroine. But her allusion to Jephtha and, later in
      the same letter, to a vow which she said she had made never to marry him
      so long as she was encumbered with debts, alleging that this was the
      &ldquo;insuperable reason&rdquo; at which she had hinted on a previous occasion, makes
      one suspicious. One feels that if she had not been practising the music of
      <i>Jephtha</i> she would not have thought about her vow not to marry him
      until she could go to him free from debt. Why, she had only to sing three
      times to release herself from that burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time afterwards she seems to have suggested such a way of getting
      over her difficulties, but it is pretty certain she knew that he would
      never listen to her. Her position at this time was undoubtedly one of
      great difficulty. Hackman was writing to her almost every day, and
      becoming more high-minded and imperious in every communication, and she
      was in terror lest some of his letters should fall into the hands of Lord
      Sandwich. She was ready to testify to his lordship's generosity in
      educating her to suit his own tastes, but she suspected its strength to
      withstand such a strain as would be put on it if he came upon one of Mr.
      Hackman's impetuous letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that when she had induced her lover to join his regiment in
      Ireland she had extricated herself from one of the difficulties that
      surrounded her; and had she been strong enough to refrain from writing to
      the man, she might have been saved from the result of her indiscretion.
      Unhappily for herself, however, she felt it incumbent on her to resume her
      correspondence with him. Upon one occasion she sent him a bank-note for
      fifty pounds, but this he promptly returned with a very proper letter.
      Indeed, all his letters from Ireland are interesting, being far less
      impassioned than those which she wrote to him. Again she mentioned having
      read <i>Werther</i>, and he promptly begged of her to send the book to
      him. &ldquo;If you do not,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;I positively never will forgive you.
      Nonsense, to say it will make me unhappy, or that I shall not be able to
      read it! Must I pistol myself because a thick-blooded German has been fool
      enough to set the example, or because a German novelist has feigned such a
      story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it would appear that she knew the man's nature better than he himself
      did, for she quickly replied: &ldquo;The book you mention is just the only book
      you should never read. On my knees I beg that you will never, never read
      it!&rdquo; But if he never read <i>Werther</i> he was never without some story
      of the same type to console him for its absence, and he seems to have
      gloated over the telling of all to her. One day he is giving her the
      particulars of a woman who committed suicide in Enniskillen because she
      married one man while she was in love with another. His comment is, &ldquo;She,
      too, was <i>Jenny</i> and had her <i>Robin Gray</i>.&rdquo; His last letter from
      Ireland was equally morbid. In it he avowed his intention, if he were not
      granted leave of absence for the purpose of visiting her, of selling out
      of his regiment. He kept his promise but too faithfully. He sold out and
      crossed to England without delay, arriving in London only to find Miss
      Reay extremely ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attempts to cheer her convalescence cannot possibly be thought very
      happy. He describes his attendance upon the occasion of the hanging of Dr.
      Dodd, the clergyman who had committed forgery; and this reminds him that
      he was unfortunately out of England when one Peter Tolosa was hanged for
      killing his sweetheart, so that he had no chance of taking part in this
      ceremony as well, although, he says, unlike George S.&mdash;meaning Selwyn&mdash;he
      does not make a profession of attending executions; adding that &ldquo;the
      friend and historian of Paoli hired a window by the year, looking out on
      the Grass Market in Edinburgh, where malefactors were hanged.&rdquo; This
      reference to Boswell is somewhat sinister. All this letter is devoted to a
      minute account of the execution of Dodd, and another deals with the
      revolting story of the butchery of Monmouth, which he suggests to her as
      an appropriate subject for a picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time he was preparing for ordination, and, incidentally, for the
      culmination of the tragedy of his life. He had undoubtedly become a
      monomaniac, his &ldquo;subject&rdquo; being murder and suicide. His last lurid story
      was of a footman who, &ldquo;having in vain courted for some time a servant
      belonging to Lord Spencer, at last caused the banns to be put up at church
      without her consent, which she forbad. Being thus disappointed he
      meditated revenge, and, having got a person to write a letter to her
      appointing a meeting, he contrived to waylay her, and surprise her in Lord
      Spencer's park. On her screaming he discharged a pistol at her and made
      his escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh love, love, canst thou not be content to make fools of thy slaves,&rdquo; he
      wrote, &ldquo;to make them miserable, to make them what thou pleasest? Must thou
      also goad them on to crimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only two more letters did he write to his victim. He took Orders and
      received the living of Wiveton, in Norfolk, seeming to take it for granted
      that, in spite of her repeated refusals to marry him, she would relent
      when she heard of the snug parsonage. This was acting on precisely the
      same lines as the butler of whom he wrote. When he found that Miss Reay
      was determined to play the part taken by the servant in the same story,
      the wretched man hurried up to London and bought his pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole story is a pitiful one. That the man was mad no one except a
      judge and jury could doubt. That his victim was amply punished for her
      indiscretion in leading him on even the strictest censor of conduct must
      allow.

    <h2>
      THE COMEDY AT DOWNING STREET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was possibly
      because she was still conscious of having occupied the commanding position
      of one of the royal bridesmaids, in spite of the two years that had
      elapsed since King George III married his homely Mecklenburg princess,
      that Lady Susan Fox-Strangways, the daughter of the first Earl of
      Ilchester, became so autocratic during the rehearsal of the Downing Street
      Comedy. A pretty fair amount of comedy as well as tragedy&mdash;with a
      preponderance of farce&mdash;has been played in the same street from time
      to time, but the special piece in which Lady Susan was interesting herself
      was to be played at the house of Sir Francis Délavai, and its name was <i>The
      School for Lovers</i>. It had been originally produced by Mr. David
      Garrick at Drury Lane Theatre, an occasion upon which a young Irish
      gentleman called O'Brien, who had disgraced himself by becoming an actor,
      had attained great distinction. The piece had drawn the town during its
      protracted run of eight nights, and Sir Francis Delaval's company of
      amateurs perceived that it was just the play for them. It was said by the
      critics that, for the first time for many years, an actor had been found
      capable of playing the part of a gentleman of fashion as if to the manner
      born. They referred to the acting of Mr. O'Brien, about whose gentlemanly
      qualities there could be no doubt. Even his own brother actors affirmed
      that no such perfect gentleman as that of O'Brien's creating had ever been
      seen on the stage. So said Lee Lewes. Another excellent judge, named
      Oliver Goldsmith, declared that William O'Brien was an elegant and
      accomplished actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this was the character, every aspiring amateur affirmed, to
      which a gentleman-born would do ample justice. When O'Brien, who was an
      actor, had represented the part with distinction, how much better would it
      not be played by the real thing&mdash;the real gentleman who might
      undertake it?
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the very plausible reasoning of the &ldquo;real gentleman&rdquo; who hoped to
      win applause by appearing in O'Brien's part in the comedy at Downing
      Street. But when the piece was rehearsed with the young Viscount B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      in the character, Lady Susan threw up her hands, and threatened to throw
      up her part as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lud!&rdquo; she cried to her associates in the temporary green-room, &ldquo;Lud! you
      would fancy that he had never seen a gentleman of fashion in his life! Why
      cannot he act himself instead of somebody else? When he comes from
      rehearsal he is the very character itself, but the moment he begins to
      speak his part he is no more the part than the link-boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one present agreed with her&mdash;the young gentlemen who were
      anxious to have the reversion of the part were especially hearty in their
      acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there could be no doubt about the matter, Lord B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      was deplorably incompetent. He was not even consistently incompetent, for
      in one scene in the second act, where there was an element of boisterous
      humour, he was tame and spiritless; but in the love-making scene, which
      brought the third act to a close, he was awkward, and so anxious to show
      his spirit that he became as vulgar as any country clown making advances
      to his Meg or Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course he felt all the time that he was doing amazingly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Susan was angry at first, and then she became witty. Her sallies,
      directed against him in every scene, were, however, lost upon him, no
      matter how calculated they were to sting him; he was too self-satisfied to
      be affected by any criticism that might be offered to him by man or woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Lady Susan was compelled to abandon her wit and to become
      natural. She flounced off the stage when her lover (in the play) was more
      than commonly loutish, and burst into tears of vexation in the arms of her
      dear friend Lady Sarah Lennox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had such a chance until now,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Never, oh, never! The
      part might have been written for me; and I implore of you, Sarah, to tell
      me candidly if Mrs. Abington or Mrs. Clive could act it with more
      sprightliness than I have shown in that last scene?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, my sweet Sue!&rdquo; cried her friend. &ldquo;I vow that I have never
      seen anything more arch than your mock rejection of your lover, only to
      draw him on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear creature!&rdquo; cried Lady Sue. &ldquo;You are a true friend and a
      competent critic, Sarah. But what signifies my acting, perfect though it
      be, when that&mdash;that idiot fails to respond in any way to the spirit
      which I display? The whole play will be damned, and people who know
      nothing of the matter will spread the report that 'twas my lack of power
      that brought about the disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cannot be so vile,&rdquo; said Lady Sarah soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they will. I know how vile some of our friends can be when it suits
      them, and when they are jealous of the acquirements of another. They will
      sneer at my best scenes&mdash;oh, the certainty that they will do so will
      be enough to make my best scenes fail. But no! they shall not have the
      chance of maligning me. I will go to Sir Francis and resign my part. Yes,
      I will! I tell you I shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The indignant young lady, with something of the stage atmosphere still
      clinging to her, flung herself with the gesture of a tortured heroine,
      proud and passionate, toward the door of the room to which the two ladies
      had retired. But before she had her fingers on the handle the door opened
      and Sir Francis Délavai entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons, my dear ladies,&rdquo; he cried, bowing to the carpet. &ldquo;I
      had forgot for the moment that when a man turns his house into a theatre
      he can call no room in it his own. But I should be a churl to suggest that
      any room in my poor house would not be made beautiful by the presence of
      your ladyships. After all, this is only my library, and a library is only
      a polite name for a dormitory, and a&mdash;but what is this? I said not a
      lacrymatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking curiously into Lady Susan's face, which retained the marks
      of her recent tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir Francis, you have come in good time,&rdquo; said Lady Sarah boldly.
      &ldquo;Here is this poor child weeping her heart out because she is condemned to
      play the part of&mdash;of what's her name?&mdash;the lady in the play who
      had to make love to an ass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, mine is a far worse plight,&rdquo; said Lady Susan, pouting. &ldquo;It were
      bad enough for one to have to make love to an ass, but how much worse is't
      not for one to be made love to by&mdash;by&mdash;my Lord B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That were a calculation far above my powers,&rdquo; said Sir Francis. &ldquo;My lord
      has never made love to me, but if rumour and the gossip at White's speak
      even a soupçon of truth, his lordship is well practised in the art&mdash;if
      love-making is an art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, 'tis a combination of all the arts,&rdquo; said Lady Susan; &ldquo;and yet my
      lord cannot simulate the least of them, which is that of being a
      gentleman, when he makes love to me on the stage, through the character of
      Captain Bellaire in our play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be plain, Sir Francis,&rdquo; said Lady Sarah, as though the other had not
      been plain enough in her explanation, &ldquo;To be plain, Lady Susan, rather
      than be associated in any measure with such a failure as your theatricals
      are bound to be if my Lord B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; remains in the part of
      her lover, has made up her mind to relinquish her part. But believe me,
      sir, she does so with deep regret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence these tears,&rdquo; said Sir Francis. &ldquo;My poor child, you are indeed in a
      pitiable state if you are so deeply chagrined at a clumsy love-making
      merely on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely on the stage?&rdquo; cried Lady Susan. &ldquo;Lud, Sir Francis, have you not
      the wit to see that to be made love to indifferently on the stage is far
      more unendurable than it would be in private, since in the one case you
      have the eyes of all the people upon you, whereas in the other case you
      are as a rule alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a rule,&rdquo; said Sir Francis. &ldquo;Yes, I perceive the difference, and I
      mingle mine own turgid tears with your limpid drops. But we cannot spare
      you from our play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you cannot, Sir Francis, but you can spare Lord B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and so can the play,&rdquo; suggested Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you would have me turn him out of the part?&rdquo; said Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so&mdash;but with politeness,&rdquo; said Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps your ladyship has solved the problem how to kick a man out of
      your house politely. If so, I would willingly pay you for the recipe; I
      have been in search of it all my life,&rdquo; said Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sir, if you kick a man hard enough with your slippers on he will
      leave your house as surely as if you wear the boots of a Life Guardsman,&rdquo;
       said Lady Susan timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it not, madam; but before trying such an experiment it would be
      well to make sure that the fellow does not wear boots himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psha! Sir Francis. If a man were to beg leave to measure the thickness of
      his enemy's soles before offering to kick him there would be very few
      cases of assault and battery,&rdquo; cried Lady Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is good philosophy&mdash;see what we have come to&mdash;philosophy,
      when we started talking of lovemaking,&rdquo; said Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However we have digressed in conversation, sir, our minds remain
      steadfast on the point round which we have been circling,&rdquo; said Lady
      Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Lord B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was thrown open and Lord B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good preliminary&mdash;one must come before one goes,&rdquo; whispered Sir
      Francis to the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship was evidently perturbed. He scarcely bowed either to Sir
      Francis or the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told that you had come hither, Sir Francis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so I
      followed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do me honour, my lord,&rdquo; said Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took a liberty, sir; but this is not a time for punctilio. I have come
      to resign my part in your play, sir,&rdquo; said his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, surely not, my lord,&rdquo; cried Sir Francis. &ldquo;What would the <i>School
      for Lovers</i> be without Bellaire, my lord? Why only now Lady Susan was
      saying&mdash;what is it that your ladyship said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had something to do with philosophy and the sole of a grenadier,&rdquo; said
      Lady Sarah interposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, was it not that his lordship's impersonation made you think of a
      scene from <i>Midsummer Night's Dream?</i>&rdquo; said Sir Francis. &ldquo;One of the
      most beautiful of Shakespeare's plays, is't not, my lord?&mdash;fantasy
      mingled with irony, an oasis of fairyland in the midst of a desert of
      daily life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about your fairyland, sir, but I have been told within the
      hour that her ladyship&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed in the direction of Lady Susan&mdash;&ldquo;has,
      during the three rehearsals which we have had of the play, been sneering
      in a covert way at my acting of the part of Bellaire, although to my face
      she seemed delighted, and thus&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that your informant was right in his interpretation of her
      ladyship's words? Surely your lordship&mdash;a man of the world&mdash;would
      have been sensible of every shade of her ladyship's meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told by one on whose judgment I can rely that Lady Susan was
      speaking in sarcasm when she complimented me before the rest of the
      company. I did not take her as doing so for myself, I must confess. I have
      always believed&mdash;on insufficient evidence, I begin to fear&mdash;that
      her ladyship was a discriminating critic&mdash;even now if she were to
      assure me that she was not speaking in sarcasm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lud! he is relenting,&rdquo; whispered Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak, madam?&rdquo; said his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was protesting against a too early exercise of your lordship's
      well-known spirit of forgiveness,&rdquo; said her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Lady Sarah; I am, I know, too greatly inclined to take a
      charitable view of&mdash;of&mdash;Why, sink me if she, too, is not trying
      to make me look ridiculous!&rdquo; cried his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my lord, I cannot believe that Lady Sarah would be at the pains to
      do for you what you can so well do for yourself,&rdquo; remarked Lady Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship looked at her&mdash;his mouth was slightly open&mdash;then he
      gazed at the smiling features of the beautiful Lady Sarah, lastly at the
      perfectly expressionless features of Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plot&mdash;a plot!&rdquo; he murmured. Then he struck a commonplace
      theatrical attitude, the &ldquo;exit attitude&rdquo; of the man who tells you that his
      time will come, though appearances are against him for the moment. He
      pointed a firm forefinger at Lady Susan, saying: &ldquo;I wash my hands clear of
      you all. I have done with you and your plays. Get another man to fill my
      place if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he rushed out through the open door. He seemed to have a shrewd
      suspicion that if he were to wait another moment one at least of the girls
      would have an effective answer to his challenge, and it is quite likely
      that his suspicion was well founded. As it was, however, owing to his wise
      precipitancy he heard no more than the pleasant laughter&mdash;it really
      was pleasant laughter, though it did not sound so to him&mdash;of the two
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the sound of the slamming of the hall-door reached the library
      the laughter in that apartment suddenly ceased. Sir Francis Délavai looked
      at each of the ladies, and both of them looked at him. For some moments no
      word was exchanged between them. At last one of them spoke&mdash;it was,
      strange to say, the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is vastly fine, ladies,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You have got rid of your <i>bête-noire</i>,
      Lady Susan; that, I say, is vastly fine, but where are you to find a <i>bête-blanche</i>
      to take his place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely we can find some gentleman willing to act the part of Bellaire?&rdquo;
       said Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is not like to be a lack of young gentlemen willing to take the
      part, but we want not merely willingness, but competence as well; and the
      piece must be played on Wednesday, even though the part of Bellaire be
      left out,&rdquo; said Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Susan looked blankly at the floor. She seemed ready to renew the
      tears which she had wept on the shoulder of her friend a short time
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I been too hasty?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Alas! I fear that I have been selfish.
      I thought only of the poor figure that I should cut with such a lover&mdash;and
      with all the world looking on, too! I should have given more thought to
      your distress, Sir Francis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, I pray of you; better have no play at all than one that all
      our kind friends will damn with the utmost cordiality and good breeding,&rdquo;
       said Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, sir, but think of the ladies' dresses!&rdquo; said Lady Sarah. &ldquo;What the
      ladies say is, 'Better produce a play that will be cordially damned rather
      than deprive us of our chance of displaying our new dresses.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Sir Francis, &ldquo;I had not thought of the new dresses. Lady
      Susan, you will e'en have to face the anger of your sisters&mdash;'tis not
      I that will tarry for such an event. I mean to fly to Bath or
      Brighthelmstone, or perchance to Timbuctoo, until the storm be overpast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, 'tis not a time for jesting, sir; let us not look at the matter
      from the standpoint of men, who do not stand but run away, let us be women
      for once, and scheme,&rdquo; said Lady Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is woman's special province,&rdquo; said Sir Francis. &ldquo;Pray begin, my lady&mdash;'twill
      be strange if your ladyship and Lady Sarah do not succeed in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Psha! there is but one man in England who could play the part of Bellaire
      on Wednesday,&rdquo; cried Lady Sarah. &ldquo;Ay, sir, and he is the only one in
      England capable of playing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall have him on our stage if I should have to pay a thousand
      pounds for his services,&rdquo; said Sir Francis. &ldquo;But where is he to be found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you guess, sir?&rdquo; asked Lady Sarah, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Francis looked puzzled, but Lady Sue started and caught her friend by
      the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lud! these girls! Here's a scheme if you will!&rdquo; muttered Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, if you will, Sir Francis. You know that I mean Mr. O'Brien himself
      and none other,&rdquo; cried Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried Lady Susan. &ldquo;My father would never consent to my
      acting in a play with a real actor&mdash;no, not even if he were Mr.
      Garrick himself. How could you suggest such a thing, Sarah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, do you mean to tell me that you would refuse to act with Mr.
      O'Brien?&rdquo; asked Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hear the child!&rdquo; cried Lady Susan. &ldquo;She asks me a question to which
      she knows only one answer is possible, and looks all the time as though
      she expected just the opposite answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know well that there are a good many ladies who would give all that
      they possess for the chance of acting with Mr. O'Brien, and you are among
      the number, my dear,&rdquo; laughed Lady Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not&mdash;I dare not. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; murmured the other
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Francis had been lost in thought while the two had been bickering over
      the body of O'Brien. He had walked across the room and seated himself for
      some moments. Now he rose and held up a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies, this is a serious matter for all of us,&rdquo; he said. And he spoke
      the truth to a greater depth than he was aware of. &ldquo;'Tis a very serious
      matter. If we get Mr. O'Brien to play the part, the piece will be the
      greatest success of the day. If we fail to get him, our theatricals will
      be damned to a certainty. Lady Susan, will you consent to play with him if
      his name does not appear upon the bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But every one would know Mr. O'Brien,&rdquo; she faltered, after a pause that
      was overcharged with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in fact; but no one will have official cognizance of him, and, as
      you must know, in these matters of etiquette everything depends upon
      official cognizance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship will have no <i>locus standi</i> in the case. He cannot take
      notice of an act that is not officially recognisable,&rdquo; suggested Sir
      Francis, the sophist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you assure me&mdash;&mdash; But is't true that Mr. O'Brien only ceased
      to become a gentleman when he became an actor?&rdquo; said Lady Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard that he relinquished the one part when he took up the
      other,&rdquo; said Sir Francis. &ldquo;I wonder that you have not met him at the
      houses of some of our friends&mdash;he is more popular even than Mr.
      Garrick. The family of O'Brien&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All kings, I doubt not,&rdquo; said Lady Susan. &ldquo;There were a good many kings
      in Ireland in the old days, I believe. I read somewhere that ninety-seven
      kings were killed in one battle, and still there were quite enough left to
      carry on the quarrels of the country. Oh, yes, there were plenty of kings,
      and their descendants have&mdash;well, descended. Mr. O'Brien descended
      pretty far when he became a play-actor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he condescends to take up the part of Bellaire at the eleventh hour to
      pluck our theatricals out of the fire we shall have every reason to be
      grateful to him,&rdquo; said Sir Francis with a severe air of reproof. He was
      beginning to be tired&mdash;as others in his place have been from time to
      time&mdash;of the capriciousness of his company of amateurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir,&rdquo; said Lady Sarah. &ldquo;Come, my dear Sue, cease to give
      yourself the airs of those ladies who, Mr. Garrick affirms, have been the
      plague of his life. If Mr. O'Brien agrees to come to our rescue you should
      have no feeling but of gratitude to him. Surely 'twere churlish on the
      part of a damsel when a gallant knight rides up to her rescue to look at
      his horse in the mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of my father,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But I am disposed to accept
      the risk of the situation. You will promise that his name will not appear
      in the bills, Sir Francis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will promise to do my best to save you from the contamination of having
      your name made as immortal as Mr. O'Brien's,&rdquo; said Sir Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah laughed, and so did her friend&mdash;after a pause sufficient
      to allow the colour that had come to her face at the stinging reproof to
      die away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that you may catch your bird, sir&mdash;your eagle&mdash;your
      Irish eagle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could tell him that Lady Sarah Lennox was to be in the cast of the
      play I should need no further lure for him,&rdquo; said Sir Francis, making his
      most exquisite bow to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, you overwhelm me,&rdquo; said Lady Sarah, sinking in her most
      ravishing courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Susan coloured once more, and her foot played a noiseless tattoo on
      the floor, for she perceived all that Sir Francis's compliment implied.
      Lady Sarah was the most beautiful girl in England, while Lady Susan was
      not even second to her, a fact of which she was as well aware as her
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how Lady Susan Fox-Strangways first met Mr. O'Brien, the actor
      whom Garrick had brought from Ireland in the year 1762. He good-naturedly
      agreed to help Sir Francis Délavai in his extremity, and his ready Irish
      tact enabled him to be the first to stipulate that his name should not
      appear in the bills&mdash;a condition with which Sir Francis complied,
      drawing a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. O'Brien,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;should the stage ever fail you, a fortune awaits
      you if you undertake the duty of teaching gentlemen the art of being a
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir, the moment that art enters the door the gentleman flies out by
      the window,&rdquo; said the actor. &ldquo;It is Nature, not art, that makes a
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One can well believe that Lady Susan Fox-Strangways, with all the pride of
      her connection with a peerage nearly ten years old, treated Mr. O'Brien's
      accession to a place in the company of amateurs with some hauteur, though
      it was said that she fell in love with him at once. On consideration, her
      bearing of hauteur which we have ventured to assign to her, so far from
      being incompatible with her having fallen in love with him, would really
      be a natural consequence of such an accident, and the deeper she felt
      herself falling the more she would feel it necessary to assert her
      position, if only for the sake of convincing herself that it was
      impossible for her to forget herself so far as to think of an Irish
      play-actor as occupying any other position in regard to her than that of a
      diversion for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was equally a matter of course that Lady Sarah should have an instinct
      of what was taking place. She had attended several of the rehearsals
      previously in the capacity of adviser to her friend, for Lady Susan had a
      high opinion of her critical capacity; but not until two rehearsals had
      taken place with O'Brien as Bellaire was she able to resume her attendance
      at Downing Street. Before half an hour had passed this astute lady had
      seen, first, that O'Brien made every other man in the cast seem a lout;
      and, secondly, that Lady Susan felt that every man in the world was a lout
      by the side of O'Brien.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hoped to discover what were the impressions of O'Brien, but she found
      herself foiled: the man was too good an actor to betray himself. The
      fervour which he threw into the character when making love to Lady Susan
      had certainly the semblance of a real passion, but what did this mean more
      than that Mr. O'Brien was a convincing actor?
    </p>
    <p>
      When she arrived at this point in her consideration of the situation Lady
      Sarah lost herself, and began to long with all her heart that the actor
      were making love to her&mdash;taking her hand with that incomparable
      devotion to&mdash;was it his art?&mdash;which he showed when Lady Susan's
      hand was raised, with a passionate glance into her eyes, to his lips;
      putting his arm about her waist, while his lips, trembling under the force
      of the protestations of undying devotion which they were uttering, were
      almost touching Lady Susan's ear. Before the love scene was over Lady
      Sarah was in love with the actor, if not with the man, O'Brien.
    </p>
    <p>
      So was every lady in the cast. O'Brien was the handsomest actor of the
      day. He had been careful of his figure at a time when men of fashion lived
      in such a way as made the preservation of a figure well-nigh impossible.
      Every movement was grace itself with him, and the period was one in which
      the costume of a man gave him every chance of at least imitating a
      graceful man. All the others in the cast of the play seemed imitating the
      gracefulness of O'Brien, and every man of them seemed a clown beside him.
      They gave themselves countless graces, but he was grace itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah saw everything that was to be seen and said nothing. She was
      wise. She knew that in due time her friend would tell her all there was to
      be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not disappointed. The play was produced, and of course every one
      recognised O'Brien in the part, although the bill&mdash;printed in gold
      letters on a satin ground, with a charming allegorical design by Lady
      Diana Spencer, showing a dozen dainty cupids going to school with satchels&mdash;stated
      that Bellaire would be represented by &ldquo;a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Equally as a matter of course a good many of the spectators affirmed that
      it was intolerable that a play-actor should be smuggled into a company of
      amateurs, some of them belonging to the best families. And then to attempt
      a deception of the audience by suggesting that O'Brien was a gentleman&mdash;oh,
      the thing was unheard of! So said some of the ladies, adding that they
      thought it rather sad that Lady Susan was not better-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of the success of the entertainment there could not be a doubt. It was
      the talk of the town for a month, and every one noticed&mdash;even her own
      father&mdash;that Lady Susan was looking extremely thin and very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah said that she had taken the diversion of the theatricals too
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it from the first, my dear Sue,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sue sprang from her chair, and it would be impossible for any one to say
      now that she was over pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw it&mdash;you&mdash;what was it that you saw from the first?&rdquo; she
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah looked at her and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is it&mdash;what was it that I saw from the first?&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;What I was going to say that I saw was simply that you were throwing
      yourself too violently into the production of the play. That was why you
      insisted on poor Lord B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s getting his <i>congé</i>.
      It was a mistake&mdash;I saw that also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you see that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I saw you taking part in that love scene with Mr. O'Brien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean you by that, Lady Sarah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what you fancy I mean, Lady Susan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Susan gazed at her blankly at first, then very pitifully. In another
      moment she had flung herself on her knees at the feet of her friend and
      was weeping in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friend was full of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor child!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;how could you help it? I vow that I
      myself&mdash;yes, for some minutes&mdash;I was as deep in love with the
      fellow as you yourself were. But, of course, you were with him longer&mdash;every
      day. Lud! what a handsome rascal he is, to be sure. His lordship must take
      you to the country without delay. Has the fellow tried to transfer the
      character in the play beyond the footlights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never&mdash;never!&rdquo; cried Susan. &ldquo;Sir Francis was right&mdash;he is a
      gentleman. That is the worst of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lud! the worst of it? Are you mad, girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not mad now, but I know that I shall be if he remains a gentleman&mdash;if
      he refrains from telling me that he loves me&mdash;or at least of giving
      me a chance of telling him that I love him. That would be better than
      nothing&mdash;'twould be such a relief. I really do not think that I want
      anything more than to be able to confess to him that I love him&mdash;that
      'tis impossible that I should love another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner you go to the country the better 'twill be for yourself and
      all of us&mdash;his lordship especially. Good heavens, child, you must be
      mad! Do you fancy that his lordship would give his consent to your
      marriage with a strolling player, let him be as handsome as Beelzebub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not a strolling player. Mr. O'Brien is in Mr. Garrick's company,
      and every one knows that he is of good family. I have been searching it
      out for the past week&mdash;all about the O'Briens&mdash;there were a
      great many of them, all of them distinguished. If it had not been that
      King James was defeated by William, in Ireland, Mr. O'Brien's grandfather
      would have been made a duke. They were all heroes, the O'Briens. And they
      were just too sincere in their devotion to the losing side&mdash;that was
      it&mdash;the losing side was always the one they took up. And yet you call
      him a strolling player!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take back the insinuation and offer him my apologies; he is not a
      strolling player because he doesn't stroll&mdash;would to Heaven he did!
      Oh, my poor Sue, take a stroll into the country yourself as soon as
      possible and try to forget this dreadfully handsome wretch. You would not,
      I am sure, force me to tell his lordship what a goose his daughter is like
      to make of herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point there was a dramatic scene, one that was far more deeply
      charged with comedy of a sort than any to be found in Mr. Whitehead's
      play. Lady Susan accused her dear friend of being a spy, of extorting a
      confession from her under the guise of friendship, which in other
      circumstances&mdash;the rack, the wheel, the thumbscrew, in fact the
      entire mechanism of persuasion employed by the Spanish Inquisition&mdash;would
      have been powerless to obtain. Lady Sarah on her side entreated her friend
      not to show herself to be even a greater goose than her confession would
      make her out to be. For several minutes there was reproach and
      counter-reproach, many home truths followed home thrusts; then some tears,
      self-accusation, expressions of sympathy and tenderness, followed by
      promises of friendship beyond the dreams of Damon and Pythias; lastly, a
      promise on the part of Sue that she would take the advice of her devoted
      Sarah and fly to the country without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, she fled to the country, and, stranger still, the result
      was not to cure her of her infatuation for the handsome actor. For close
      upon a year she did not see him, but she was as devoted to him as she had
      been at first, and no day passed on which she failed to think of him, or
      to spend some hours writing romantic verses, sometimes in the style of
      Waller in his lyrics, sometimes in the style (distant) of Mr. Dryden in
      his pastorals: she was Lesbia, and Mr. O'Brien was Strephon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the meantime she had improved so much in her acting that when Lady
      Sarah, who had within the year married Sir Thomas Bunbury, ventured to
      rally her upon her infatuation of the previous spring, she was able to
      disarm her suspicions by a flush and a shrug, and a little contemptuous
      exclamation or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear one, did not I give you good advice?&rdquo; cried Lady Sarah. &ldquo;I
      was well assured that my beloved Sue would never persevere in a passion
      that could only end in unhappiness. But indeed, child, I never had the
      heart to blame you greatly, the fellow is handsome as Apollo and as proud
      as Apolyon. He has broken many hearts not accounted particularly fragile,
      during the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is't possible? For example?&mdash;I vow that I shall keep their names
      secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sarah shook her head at first, but on being importuned whispered a
      name or two of ladies of their acquaintance, all of whom&mdash;according
      to Lady Sarah&mdash;had fallen as deep as was possible in love with
      O'Brien. Her ladyship was so intent on her narration of the scandals that
      she quite failed to see the strange light that gleamed in her friend's
      eyes at the mention of every name&mdash;a rather fierce gleam, with a
      flash of green in it. She did not notice this phenomenon, nor did she
      detect the false note in the tribute of laughter which her friend paid to
      her powers of narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Sue, when the other had left her, rushed to her room and flung
      herself on her bed in a paroxysm of jealousy. She beat her innocent pillow
      wildly, crying in the whisper that the clenching of her teeth made
      imperative&mdash;&ldquo;The hussies! Shameless creatures! Do they hope that he
      will be attracted to them? Fools!&mdash;they are fools! They do not know
      him as I know him. They think that he is nothing but a vain actor&mdash;Garrick,
      or Barry, or Lewes. Oh, they do not know him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lay there in her passion for an hour, and if it was her maid who
      discovered her at the end of that time, it is safe to assume that the
      young woman's flesh was black and blue in places for several days
      afterwards. The pinch and the slipper were among the most highly approved
      forms of torture inflicted upon their maids at that robust period of
      English history. The French Revolution was still some way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks later Lady Susan was sitting to Sir Joshua Reynolds for a
      group, in which he painted her with her friend Lady Sarah Bunbury and Mr.
      Henry Fox; and it was the carrying out of this scheme that put quite
      another scheme into the quick brain of the first-named lady. Painting was
      in the air. She possessed a poor print of Mr. O'Brien, and she had found
      an immense consolation in gazing upon it&mdash;frequently at midnight,
      under the light of her bedroom candle. The sight of the life-like
      portraits in Sir Joshua's studio induced her to ask herself if she might
      not possess a picture of her lover that would show him as he really was in
      life, without demanding so many allowances as were necessary to be made
      for the shortcomings of the engraver of a print. Why should she not get
      Sir Joshua Reynolds to paint for her the portrait of Mr. O'Brien?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0016" id="linkimage-0016"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0379.jpg" alt="0379 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0379.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The thought was a stimulating one, and it took possession of her for a
      week. At the end of that time, however, she came to the conclusion that it
      would be unwise for her to employ Sir Joshua on a commission that might
      possibly excite some comment on the part of her friends should they come
      to learn&mdash;and the work of this particular painter was rather inclined
      to be assertive&mdash;that it had been executed to her order. But she was
      determined not to live any longer without a portrait of the man; and,
      hearing some one mention at Sir Joshua's house the name of Miss Catherine
      Read, who was described as an excellent portrait painter, she made further
      inquiry, and the result was that she begged her father, the Earl of
      Ilchester, who was devoted to her, to allow her to have her portrait done
      by Miss Read, to present to Lady Sarah on her birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Miss Read was delighted to have the patronage of so great a
      family&mdash;she had not yet done her famous pastel of the Duchess of
      Argyll&mdash;and Susan, accompanied by her footman, lost no time in
      beginning her series of sittings to the artist to whom Horace Walpole
      referred as &ldquo;the painteress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was both patient and discreet, for three whole days elapsed before she
      produced a mezzotint of Mr. O'Brien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you would condescend to draw a miniature portrait of his
      lordship's favourite actor from so poor a copy as this, Miss Read?&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Have you ever seen this Mr. O'Brien&mdash;an Irishman, I believe he
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Read assured her that Mr. O'Brien was her favourite actor also. The
      print produced was indeed a poor one; it quite failed to do justice to the
      striking features of the original, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt certain that it could bear but a meagre resemblance to Mr. O'Brien
      if all that I hear of the man be true,&rdquo; said Lady Susan. &ldquo;His lordship
      swears that there has never been so great an actor in England, and I
      should like to give him a surprise by presenting to him a miniature
      portrait of his favourite, done by the cunning pencil of Miss Read, on his
      birthday. I protest that 'tis a vast kindness you are doing me in
      undertaking such a thing. But mind, I would urge of you to keep the affair
      a profound secret. I wish it as a surprise to my father, and its effect
      would be spoilt were it to become known to any of his friends that I had
      this intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship may rest assured that no living creature will hear of the
      affair through me,&rdquo; said the painteress. &ldquo;But I heartily wish that your
      ladyship could procure for me a better copy than this print from which to
      work,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that I cannot promise you that; I found two other prints of the
      same person, but they are worse even than this,&rdquo; said Lady Susan. &ldquo;You
      must do your best with the material at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship may depend on my doing my best,&rdquo; replied Miss Read. &ldquo;When
      does his lordship's birthday take place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship was somewhat taken aback by the sudden question. It took her
      some time to recollect that her father's birthday was to be within a
      month. She felt that she could not live for longer than another month
      without a portrait of the man whom she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was going home in her chair she could not but feel that she had
      hitherto been an undutiful daughter, never having taken any interest in
      her father's birthday, and being quite unacquainted with its date. She
      hoped fervently that Miss Read would not put herself to the trouble to
      find out exactly on what day of what month it took place. The result of
      such an investigation might be a little awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Miss Read took no trouble in this direction. All her
      attention was turned upon the task of making a presentable miniature out
      of the indifferent material with which she had been supplied for this
      purpose. She began wondering if it might not be possible to get O'Brien to
      sit to her half a dozen times in order to give her a chance of doing
      credit to herself and to the gentleman's fine features.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still pondering over this question when her attendant entered with
      a card, saying that a gentleman had come to wait on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read the name on the card, and uttered an exclamation of surprise, for
      the name was that of the man of whom she was thinking&mdash;Mr. O'Brien,
      of Drury Lane Theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had wholly failed to recover herself before he entered the studio, and
      advanced to her, making his most respectful bow. He politely ignored her
      flutter-ings&mdash;he was used to see her sex overwhelmed when he
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I beg that you will pardon this intrusion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have taken
      the liberty of waiting upon you, knowing of your great capacity as an
      artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; cried the fluttered little lady, making her courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, madam, I have no intention of flattering one to whom compliments
      must be as customary as they are well deserved,&rdquo; said the actor. &ldquo;I come
      not to confer a favour, madam, but to entreat one. In short, Miss Read, I
      am desirous of presenting a valued friend of mine with the portrait of a
      lady for whom he entertains a sincere devotion. For certain reasons, which
      I need not specify, the lady cannot sit to you; but I have here a picture
      of her poorly done in chalks, from which I hope it may be in your power to
      make a good&mdash;a good&mdash;&mdash; Good heavens! what do I behold? 'Tis
      she&mdash;she&mdash;Lady Susan herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had glanced round the studio in the course of his speech, and his eyes
      had alighted upon the newly-begun portrait of Lady Susan. It represented
      only a few days' work, but the likeness to the original had been ably
      caught, and no one could fail to recognise the features.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a hurried step to the easel, and the air made by his motion
      dislodged a print which the artist had laid on the little ledge that
      supported the stretcher of the canvas. The print fluttered to the floor;
      he picked it up, and gave another exclamation on recognising his own
      portrait in the mezzotint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking from the print to the picture and then at Miss Read, he said in a
      low voice, after a pause&mdash;&ldquo;Madam, I am bewildered. Unless you come to
      my assistance I protest I shall feel that I am dreaming and asleep. Pray,
      madam, enlighten me&mdash;for Heaven's sake tell me how this&rdquo;&mdash;he
      held up the print&mdash;&ldquo;came into such close juxtaposition with that&rdquo;&mdash;he
      pointed to the portrait on the easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis easily told, sir,&rdquo; said Miss Read, smiling archly. &ldquo;But I must leave
      it to your sense of honour to keep the matter a profound secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Mr. O'Brien with dignity, &ldquo;Madam, I am an Irishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough, sir; I know that I can trust you. The truth is, Mr.
      O'Brien, that Lady Susan is sitting to me for her portrait&mdash;that
      portrait. 'Twas marvellous that you should recognise it so soon. I have
      not worked at it for many hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, your art is beyond that of the magician. 'Tis well known that
      every form depicted by Miss Read not only breathes but speaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, I vow that you are a flatterer; still, you did recognise the
      portrait&mdash;'tis to be presented to Lady Sarah Bunbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship will be the most fortunate of womankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which ladyship, sir&mdash;Lady Susan or Lady Sarah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, madam.&rdquo; The Irishman was bowing with his hand on his heart. &ldquo;But
      the print&mdash;my poor likeness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the secret, sir; but you will not betray it when I tell you that
      Lady Susan entrusted that print to me in order that I might make a copy in
      miniature for her to present to her father, Lord Ilchester. You are his
      favourite actor, Mr. O'Brien, as no doubt you are aware.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis the first I heard of it, madam.&rdquo; There was a suggestion of
      mortification in the actor's tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, 'twould be impossible for Mr. O'Brien to keep an account of all his
      conquests. But now you can understand how it is that her ladyship wishes
      her intention to be kept a secret: she means to add to the acceptability
      of her gift by presenting it as a surprise. But her secret is safe in your
      keeping, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to it, madam.&rdquo; Mr. O'Brien spoke mechanically. His hand was on
      his chin: he was clearly musing upon some question that perplexed him. He
      took a turn up and down the studio, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, it has just occurred to me that you, as a great artist&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; interposed the blushing painteress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not take back a word, madam,&rdquo; said the actor, holding up one
      inexorable hand. &ldquo;I say that surely so great an artist as you should
      disdain to do the work of a mere copyist. Why should not you confer upon
      me the honour of sitting to you for the miniature portrait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, that is the one favour which I meant to ask of you, if my
      courage had not failed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you will confer immortality upon a simple man through that magic
      wand which you wield.&rdquo; He swept his hand with inimitable grace over the
      mahl-stick which lay against the easel. &ldquo;I am all impatient to begin my
      sitting, Miss Read. Pray let me come to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship comes to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall precede her ladyship. Name the hour, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without the least demur Miss Read named an hour which could enable him to
      be far away from the studio before Lady Susan's arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the next day Lady Susan entered the studio quite half an hour
      before Mr. O'Brien had left it. Of course she was surprised. Had not Miss
      Read received a letter, making her aware of the fact that she, Lady Susan,
      would be forced, owing to circumstances over which she had no control, to
      sit for her portrait an hour earlier than that of her appointment?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Read said she had received no such letter, Lady Susan said some
      very severe things about her maid. Miss Read was greatly fluttered, but
      she explained in as few words as possible how it was that Mr. O'Brien had
      come forward in the cause of art, and was sitting for the miniature. Lady
      Susan quickly got over her surprise. (Had Miss Read seen the letter which
      her ladyship had received the previous evening from Mr. O'Brien she would
      not have marvelled as she did at the rapidity with which her ladyship
      recovered her self-possession.) Her ladyship was quite friendly with the
      actor, and thanked him for his courtesy in offering to give up so much of
      his time solely for the sake of increasing the value of her gift to her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, while they were discussing some point in the design
      of the picture, Miss Read was called out of the studio, and in a second
      Lady Susan was in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fate is on our side, darling girl!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not live without you, my charmer. But I was bold! I took my fate
      in both hands when I wrote you that letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear one, 'twas the instinct of true love that made you guess the truth&mdash;that
      I wanted the portrait because I loved the original. Oh, dear one, what
      have I not suffered during the year that has parted us!&rdquo; said Lady Susan,
      with her head upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irishman found it necessary to fall back upon the seductive tongue of
      his country for words of endearment to bestow upon her. He called her
      &ldquo;Sheila,&rdquo; &ldquo;a cushla machree,&rdquo; &ldquo;mavourneen,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;aroon.&rdquo; But when
      Miss Read returned to the studio they were still discussing a purely
      artistic point in connection with the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course now that O'Brien knew the secret of the miniature there was no
      reason that Miss Read could see why he and Lady Susan should not meet at
      her studio. To do her justice, neither could her ladyship perceive why
      they should not come together at this place. They came every day, and
      every day Lady Susan begged that Miss Read would allow her to rest in her
      ante-room after the fatigue of the sitting. She rested in that room, and
      in the company of O'Brien, until at last Miss Read became frightened; and
      one day told her friend Lord Cathcart something of her fears. Lord
      Cathcart, in his turn, told Lord Ilchester. His lordship was furious, but
      cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted evidence of his daughter's infatuation. He got it the next
      morning, for he insisted on seeing a letter which arrived for Lady Susan,
      addressed in the handwriting of Lady Sarah. This letter turned out to be
      from O'Brien, and Susan confessed that her father's surmise was correct&mdash;all
      the letters which she had recently received in Lady Sarah's hand had come
      from O'Brien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father was foolish enough to grant her permission to say farewell to
      her lover, and thus the two were allowed to come together once more. They
      had a long talk, in the course of which O'Brien communicated to her a
      secret of the theatre, which was that Mr. Garrick and Mr. Colman were
      engaged in the construction of a comedy to be called <i>The Clandestine
      Marriage</i>, and that Mr. Garrick told him that he, O'Brien, was to play
      the part of the lover&mdash;the gentleman who had married the lady in
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Susan parted from her lover, not in tears, but in laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of the story is told by Horace Walpole, writing to Lord
      Hertford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have heard of the sad misfortune that has happened to Lord
      Ilchester by his daughter's marriage with O'Brien, the actor,&rdquo; wrote
      Walpole; and then went on to tell how Lady Susan had made her confession
      to her father, vowing to have nothing more to do with her lover if she
      were but permitted to bid him good-bye. &ldquo;You will be amazed,&rdquo; continued
      Walpole, &ldquo;even this was granted. The parting scene happened the beginning
      of the week. On Friday she came of age, and on Saturday morning&mdash;instead
      of being under lock and key in the country&mdash;walked downstairs, took
      her footman, said she was going to breakfast with Lady Sarah, but would
      call at Miss Read's; in the street pretended to recollect a particular cap
      in which she was to be drawn, sent the footman back for it, whipped into a
      hackney chair, was married at Covent Garden Church, and set out for Mr.
      O'Brien's villa at Dunstable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unlike many other alliances of a similar type, this marriage turned out a
      happy one. O'Brien was induced to leave the stage and to depart with his
      wife for America. He obtained a grant of some forty thousand acres in the
      province of New York, and had he retained this property and taken the
      right side during the Revolution his descendants would to-day be the
      richest people in the world. A few years later he was given a good
      appointment in Bermuda; and finally, in 1770, he was made Receiver-General
      of the County of Dorset, and became popular as a country squire. He died
      in 1815, and Lady Susan survived him by twelve years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Lady Sarah who had made the imprudent marriage. She submitted to
      the cruelties of her husband for fourteen years, and on her leaving his
      roof he obtained a divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1781, nineteen years after her first marriage, she wedded the Hon.
      George Napier, and became the mother of three of the greatest Englishmen
      of the nineteenth century. She lived until she was eighty. Her friend Lady
      Susan followed her to the grave a year later, at the age of eighty-four.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
